Trump's administration could count many successes, especially on the economy and trade, and in curbing illegal immigration before the COVID-19 pandemic derailed him. Yet the D.C. establishment and its army of federal bureaucrats survived more or less intact. Indeed, many of these ""deep state"" warriors at the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., and the intelligence agencies played a role in aiding and abetting the Russia collusion hoax that did so much to undermine Trump's first years in office.


Part of the problem was that many of Trump's appointments to key posts, including Cabinet secretaries, failed him. With most of those who would normally serve in Republican administrations shunning him, Trump had few loyalists able to take on major responsibilities. His first cabinet picks were often establishment figures; they were either not on board with his reformist goals or lacked the will to prevent the permanent government employees in their departments from slow-walking or sabotaging Trump's agenda.

He's not making that same mistake again.",Republican

I know carpenters and electricians that make well over 100k a year.

The Democrats better get their shit together, but they are blind to their party bs. Hispanics know it pretty well, we hate communism in general lines.

Congrats on the victory!  What are we thinking the legislative priorities should be when the new Republican government kicks off in January?  Seems like we need to do both taxes and immigration reform and I would personally want any tax cuts to come with spending cuts to get to balanced budgets (or at least reduced deficits).  

I personally hope that Trump and his administration develop a more targeted plan on tariffs.  It is a good idea to get certain prioritized manufacturing sectors (e.g., semiconductors, medical supplies) back, but that needs to be planned out carefully given our aging workforce (particularly if we cut back on immigration).  It has been a long time since I took International Economics in college but I think the empirical evidence has strongly suggested that blanket tariffs are pretty bad on a net basis.  Hopefully, he and his economic advisors can iron out a plan on tariffs that is more targeted (like he did in his last administration).  I have been (perhaps irrationally) worried that doing mass deportations, spending cuts, and tariffs at the same time could risk creating a recession due to the shock to the system.  Scrapping the tariff part and spacing out the spending cuts would likely reduce those risks.  In any event, should be interesting to see what the new government does early!  Seems like the markets are happy.  ",Republican

The whole message is that if you vote for Trump you don‚Äôt care about women. But as a woman who has a daughter I feel like I HAD to vote Trump to protect rights she has that are much bigger than abortion. Her right to free speech, her right to assemble, to protest, her right to exist as a female in exclusively female spaces like sports and restrooms, to bear arms, her right to a secure border and safe streets, her right to not have gender confusion or mutilation pushed onto her, her right to be educated and raised by her parents and not the government. Most importantly her right to be an innocent child.

Wade was overturned (Shocker: It's not what the Democrat Legacy Media Says) ,11,1gkhmgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/1gkhmgh/why_roe_v_wade_was_overturned_shocker_its_not/,1,2024-11-05 21:18:19,"Wrote this out to respond in r/AskReddit but I guess the person deleted their comment. I am in my 2nd year of law school, conservative, and tired of seeing the left media screaming that Trump stripped rights from women. Yes, he did nominate the justices that led to Dobbs ruling, but the left leaning Supreme Court of Roe v. Wade set themselves up for failure.



To understand what led to the case being overturned, you must understand the history of SCOTUS substantive due process cases leading up to it. 

Substantive due process claims help incorporate unenumerated rights into the constitution. In the early 20th century case *Lochner*, SCOTUS incorporated the ‚Äúliberty to contract‚Äù which essentially constitutionalized the free market economy. This has been critiqued by all political ideologies because many view that SCOTUS shouldn‚Äôt create constitutional protections out of thin air (this is what the modern Supreme Court of Canada does through their ‚Äúliving tree doctrine‚Äù). The famous Justice Holmes dissent from this case essentially puts forward that the issue at hand (baking workers regulations) should be a **state issue**.¬†



In the decades to come, the Supreme Court was weary of coming off as having ‚ÄúLochnerized‚Äù as everyone agrees it‚Äôs an overstepping of the courts governing abilities. Beginning in the 30s the court moved away from substantive due process and began asking whether the laws were related to a legitimate government interest. Pre modern era substantive due process cases, (*Skinner, Meyer)* all involve rights not found in the constitution but recognized as constitutional liberties that couldn‚Äôt be taken away from the state without justification.¬†



Then you move to the privacy cases, *Griswald* (the contraception case) was done through denying Lochner but stating that there are **zones of privacy** within the **penumbras** of the bill of rights and constitution, and here is where you find the right for a married woman to use contraception. Not a direct right to use contraception, but a right to privacy surrounding the marriage relationship. Justice Harlem concurs but with the idea that rather than using penumbras, we can establish it through a living tradition in the United States.¬†



Moving to *Michael H. v. Gerald D.* Where a California law created a legal presumption that a child born to a couple was the the child of that couple. Here a women had an affair, and the man who she had the affair with fought for parental rights and raised a substantive due process claim. Justice Scalia debated Justice Brennan over the approach to substantive due process. Scalia urged for the historical approach, because the method of interpreting substantive due process needed to be narrowed, or at least have ‚Äúrules to the game.‚Äù He wanted a historical approach at the narrowest level of generality, because if you didn‚Äôt, it gave judges too much power (Similar to Canadas living tree doctrine as I mentioned previously).¬†



Justice Brennan argued against this approach because all you would be doing is validating the beliefs of past political majorities (since they establish tradition) and essentially argued for a living constitution. Scalia rebutted by stating that through taking rights and not protecting them under the constitution, we actually leave room for the people of the country to voice their opinions at the state level and **Debate issues**.¬†



So we move to *Roe v. Wade.* Rather than ground the right to an abortion in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, or in the history and tradition of the United States, SCOTUS decided to explicitly use substantive due process (which is essentially ‚Äúlochnerizing‚Äù). The court used the concept of liberty and privacy as a route to establish this right, but still lacked a valid leg to stand on regarding precedent. 



(Skipping planned parenthood v. Casey bc its more the of same essentially but it removed the trimester framework created by roe. It established the viability framework and I have class soon so running out of time)¬†



Moving to Dobbs, the reason it was overturned is because there has been a longstanding issue at the SCOTUS regarding substantive due process. To avoid creating this overextending judicial power (again like I said before, similar to Canada) where judges can create protections not explicitly seen in the constitution, they overruled Roe v. Wade. Essentially, they decided to use the historical approach mentioned before, as there is no basis in text, precedent, and tradition for a right to an abortion. Unenumerated due process rights must be established through US tradition, which is not something abortion is either in common law or US law.¬†This allows the STATES to argue and debate their views on abortion, rather than just completely take it out of the people's hands.



So now, abortion legislation is judged based on the **rational basis standard.** The Mississippi law that was at issue was valid because it was deemed that there was a legitimate state interest in protecting the life of a fetus.¬†



Essentially, they should‚Äôve taken another route taken for the protection of abortion, rather than attempting to do it through substantive due process. Now they complain because their flimsy method was overturned. HOWEVER, it is very likely that this ruling will be overturned at some point in the future, simply due to political beliefs, the ever-changing opinions of substantive due process, or court packing by the left. But yes, there is a legal process that needs to be followed, and the idea that the court just decided to do whatever they want is EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT FROM HAPPENING. Substantive due process is the vessel for things to be taken out of the peoples hands. (There is a lot of good that comes from it, but people have been trying to exploit it incessantly). ",Republican

So I have just voted in my first ever presidential election. By the title of this, you know who I voted for. Let‚Äôs also say that I‚Äôm a minority in almost every (common sensual) way. I befriended a lot of left leaning people before the election, and I love them dearly. I truly and genuinely hope that whoever becomes president will do right by this country. I know that‚Äôs a lot of faith for very corrupt people, however I‚Äôm sick of the mindset of hating your neighbor/friend/family for voting on opposing views. I used to be the very opposite of what I‚Äôm preaching, so I‚Äôm very familiar with that mindset. If I told myself even a year ago that I was voting for Trump, I‚Äôd probably cuss myself out or think I was delusional‚Ä¶ like for real. I was very anti Trump, anti Republican Party, and anti anyone who supported anything to do with Republican/libertarian views. I do not agree with every point that Trump has made, so let‚Äôs be clear about that. I 100% do not agree on how he wants to handle the wars having to do with Gaza/Palestine and Ukraine. The one thing I will say though is we do NOT need to be funding other wars and genocides while our nations people continue to suffer unemployment, a housing crisis, and inflation. Additionally, however, I have been very fond of taking care of American citizens and an economic boom. This would mean creating mass job opportunities, allowing for energy in the US, and allowing those who want to be legal citizens in the country. I also want to see more done about crime, mass sh00tings, and policing which I feel like Trump and Kamala have been silent and/or have not really spoken on. I did a lot of research and watch both candidates speak in interviews, rallies, and more. I made an informed decision, but it sucks that I can‚Äôt tell anyone who I voted for. No advice needed here, but I thought I‚Äôd just share a perspective that some could relate to.

-A secure border
- An end to funding wars 
-The protection of human life at all stages from from conception to natural death
- The protection of children from a billion dollar industry that wants to mutilate their bodies before they turn 18
- The protection of femboys and Tom boys who would grow up in any other age to just be gay or gender non conforming
- The right to 100% free speech - freedom of speech IS freedom from consequences from the government 
- The right to have the first female  president win because she is better than any man in power - not because she is a DEI
- The protection of women from men invading their spaces
- The protection from the state forcing a sh0t onto me
- The protection of my religion (Christianity) from an atheist death cult 
- The protection of ill√©gal migrant children and innocent refugees (make them citizens, not slaves)
- The continued criminalization of mind altering drugs 
- The protection from sterilizing children who aren‚Äôt trusted to drink or vote or get a tattoo, but for some reason can destroy their bodies 
- The right to ‚Äújust be gay‚Äù 
- The protection from erasure of the homosexual and lesbian communities by the alphabet mafia who seek to redefine what gay is 
- The protection from transgender people from military service 

Trump didn‚Äôt get rid of gay marriage back in 2016, when he had a Republican super majority. He does not endorse Pr0ject 2025. He did not ban transitioning for consenting adults. He did not not ban gay people from adopting. So if you‚Äôre voting today (which I beg you to do) because you ‚Äúcare about the interests‚Äù of your gay friends and family?

Just spoke to a Democrat consultant friend on the ground in a swing state who told me I could repeat some of what we discussed. Here's what I can tell you; take it with a grain of salt if you like but I think he's being straight with me.

Nobody really thinks Kamala is going to win at this point. Canvassing is going poorly almost everywhere, with few exceptions. The party is getting their high-follower influencer accounts to push out motivational stories just to keep morale up and get them over the finish line with some dignity, but it's not great. The Iowa poll was good to give a shot of adrenaline to volunteers, but nobody important believes those numbers are real.

Of all the swing states, they're hoping Michigan comes through and possibly a late-night miracle in PA, but nobody is counting on either of them. They don't think Trump is actually going to flip VA or NH, but the fact that they've even entered the conversation is indicative of how bad things could potentially turn out.

The early vote counts are just beyond what they expected to see for Republican turnout, and has Dem strategists rethinking whether it was a good idea to make such a big push to broaden early voting in the first place. Republican low-propensity voters are activated in a way nobody really expected and the polls didn't capture it.

I see it as narcissistic abuse. The gaslighting, the manipulation, the guilt tripping. Obviously the most frustrating one is being called fascists, racists, Donald Trump being called a dictator/hitler/authoritarian. 

It is completely illogical to call us the fascists or nazis when the majority of leftists will hate you and see you as a terrible person if you tell them you‚Äôre a Trump supporter. But Trump supporters/republicans couldn‚Äôt care less if you‚Äôre a democrat. Two women today came into the restaurant I work at wearing Kamala 2024 tee shirts and I treated them with kindness, respect, and had genuinely zero animosity towards them. 

How are we the fascists or nazis when two of our most core values is protecting freedom of speech and the right to bare arms (against the government)? Yet they can just continue to spew these awful, divisive terms at us. It‚Äôs NOT OKAY. 

The comfort these people in power have saying these things is so scary. The reality is THEIR behavior is the only thing close to nazi germany, and while we‚Äôre at it, didn‚Äôt they melt down whenever republicans compared things to nazi germany or the holocaust in the past?

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term ‚Äî chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

We don't think like the Left does, AND THAY CAN'T EVEN COMPUTE WHAT THAT'S LIKE!

So as Trumpeteers, we should celebrate that we still have liberated souls with our votes and voices!

What turned me from the Left to the Right was exactly the culture difference. Live a happier culture is probably the most important thing in my eyes!

And remember, most poor Lefties are decent people just caught up in what I call ""the machine"", but I think more people are spotting what the machine is, and when they do, they'll be way more frightened of that than just a old goofy ginger man that's swinging a cudgel at it.

Since Joe Biden wanted to call all of us loving patriots ""garbage"" I decided to vote early instead of on the 5th.

So I went and voted for President Trump and our allys before the rally. 

To my humble surprise Donald was a garbage man just like me.

I can't believe people are still talking about January 6th like he had something to do with it. This feels like a nightmare. Inflation has made things so freaking expensive and that was a DIRECT result of Biden/Harris. I'm just shocked that people talk so badly about his supporters. 

Do I wish he was a more polished speaker? Heck yes! He drives me nuts when he rambles, but I'm looking at actions and I know he isn't a politician so I give him a pass for that.

Calling him a threat to democracy is the biggest lie in politics since Hillary Clinton called him a Russian agent. We know how that worked out for her. 

Another scurrilous effort by Dems is the naked appeal to race. Both of the Obamas created a new bottom by scolding black men who do not support her. 

Harris certainly played along, adopting various versions of Southern accents when she spoke to predominantly black audiences. 

Stripped of all niceties, it‚Äôs an appeal that says all black Americans must vote for all black candidates. No wonder race relations are going backward at a rapid clip.",Republican

We‚Äôre days away from the election, and she still can‚Äôt answer basic layup questions about her priorities. To the extent she‚Äôs offered any policy specifics (capital gains tax) they‚Äôve been provably bad ideas. She also has no charm. All she can run on is baseless fear-mongering. 

Meanwhile, Trump, imperfect as he may be, is offering a team that includes Vance, Musk, RFK Jr., Gabbard and Ramaswamy. Because of that, this was the most enthusiastic I‚Äôd ever been to vote. I‚Äôm excited by the prospect that we might actually slash federal bureaucracy, get the deficit under control, bring manufacturing (and all the related industries and services) back to the U.S., and fight evil corporate forces that are poisoning us. These are the great issues of our time, along with stopping the invasion at our Southern border.

We have to win. A popular vote victory would be the cherry on top. Please vote (in person if possible), even if you‚Äôre not in a swing state.

765,The Washington octopus,7,1gba87n,https://newcriterion.com/article/the-washington-octopus/,1,2024-10-24 19:51:55,"The District of Columbia, the capital city and seat of government for the United States, contains a population of roughly 700,000 in a condensed area of sixty square miles. That population has remained steady over the post-war decades as the reach of the capital city has expanded outward into adjacent counties in Maryland and Virginia.


Everyone who has seen the musical Hamilton knows that the nation‚Äôs capital was moved to the present site in the District of Columbia due to a dinner-table bargain in 1790 between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Hamilton needed Jefferson‚Äôs support in Congress to win approval for the federal assumption of Revolutionary War debts; in return, Jefferson wanted Hamilton‚Äôs support to move the capital from New York City to a location nearer to the population and geographical center of the country, later mapped out by President Washington in a district between Maryland and Virginia.


The capital city increasingly directs the voters rather than being controlled by them. After all, government operates continuously, with influential decisions made on a day-to-day basis, while voters show up at the polls episodically every two or four years. The range and scale of operations in the capital are now so vast that voters can have little hope of controlling or even understanding them. Notwithstanding its alliance with the Democrats, the capital has developed into a kind of political party in its own right.


Voters across the country appear to have a rough sense of the degree to which influence has been concentrated in the capital, often in opposition to their wishes or interests. Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters, gathered at his rallies, called upon him to ‚Äúdrain the swamp,‚Äù a reference to the widespread corruption they saw taking place in Washington. It did not take long after Trump‚Äôs election in 2016 for several government agencies, including the fbi, cia, and Department of Justice, to come forward with a campaign to drive him from office, or distract him with so many investigations as to make it difficult for him to address the concerns that animated his voters. This was the ‚Äúdeep state,‚Äù as he and his supporters called it, another layer of influence burrowed inside the government, operating through clandestine avenues to discredit threats to what they regarded as the national interest. It appeared that though the voters selected Trump, the capital party was determined to spit him out.",Republican

Pennsylvania is looking like the big one, folks, and Trump has serged in every battleground state since Kamala's Fox News interview. Obviously it isn't over if he doesn't take Pennsylvania and any state can swing in theory, but that would be the clearest path to victory.
