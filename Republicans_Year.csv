I‚Äôm gonna ask you - if you‚Äôre voting for a candidate who didn‚Äôt even have a primary election because you have a gay or transgender friend of family member, and you ‚Äúcare about their interests,‚Äù as a gay man diagnosed with gender dysphoria here are my interests:

-A secure border
- An end to funding wars 
-The protection of human life at all stages from from conception to natural death
- The protection of children from a billion dollar industry that wants to mutilate their bodies before they turn 18
- The protection of femboys and Tom boys who would grow up in any other age to just be gay or gender non conforming
- The right to 100% free speech - freedom of speech IS freedom from consequences from the government 
- The right to have the first female  president win because she is better than any man in power - not because she is a DEI
- The protection of women from men invading their spaces
- The protection from the state forcing a sh0t onto me
- The protection of my religion (Christianity) from an atheist death cult 
- The protection of ill√©gal migrant children and innocent refugees (make them citizens, not slaves)
- The continued criminalization of mind altering drugs 
- The protection from sterilizing children who aren‚Äôt trusted to drink or vote or get a tattoo, but for some reason can destroy their bodies 
- The right to ‚Äújust be gay‚Äù 
- The protection from erasure of the homosexual and lesbian communities by the alphabet mafia who seek to redefine what gay is 
- The protection from transgender people from military service 

Trump didn‚Äôt get rid of gay marriage back in 2016, when he had a Republican super majority. He does not endorse Pr0ject 2025. He did not ban transitioning for consenting adults. He did not not ban gay people from adopting. So if you‚Äôre voting today (which I beg you to do) because you ‚Äúcare about the interests‚Äù of your gay friends and family? Well I‚Äôm gay, and here‚Äôs my interests.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term ‚Äî chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

2nd pic: However, with the run Trump has been on the past two weeks, all he needs is Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina to seal it.

So essentially, even if they found a way to flip Arizona (1.5% Trump lead), take Nevada (Deadlock), Wisconsin (Deadlock), and Michigan (Deadlock), it still wouldn't be enough.

Pennsylvania is looking like the big one, folks, and Trump has serged in every battleground state since Kamala's Fox News interview. Obviously it isn't over if he doesn't take Pennsylvania and any state can swing in theory, but that would be the clearest path to victory.

The Trump team went before the appeals court in the civil fraud trial with Letitia James in New York, and the Appeals judges couldn‚Äôt understand why James brought this case in the first place.

Prosecutors questioned if there has ever been a case on record like this in the history.

They continuously asked her legal team for examples of anyone ever bringing a case like this before, and even insinuated it must be political. In closing arguments the James team spent a bulk of their time begging not to be sanctioned for weaponizing the Justice System.

MEmbers of the DOJ who helped prosecute this case must be investigated. James should be disbarred and indicted for abuse of power and election interference. The millions of dollars that Trump paid in legal fees should be reimbursed with interest.

Have to say after my experience I'm pretty worried.... I know the rules are no campaigning within 100ft of the building. Yet, there were multiple Democrat campaigners campaigning literally 20ft from the main entrance. Security was right there and they did nothing. I waited to see if they were asked to leave by the time I came out (almost an hour standing in line and voting). But they weren't. I had to go to security and tell them those people are not supposed to be doing that. Security told me they would take care of it, so I drove around the block and they finally asked them to leave. But there was another one only 15ft away from the first. It was definately not 100ft, so I drove up to the same security guy and told him about the second one. He just said ""OK, I'll take care of it"". I slowly started driving away and he never got on his phone like the first one. Tried to tell another campaigner to call whoever they know to stop it, and I left. Made me angry to be honest. On top of it, every single poll worker there I honestly felt was a Democrat. Don't ask me how I knew, I can't tell you. It just seemed pretty obvious. I think they felt they knew I was a Republican voter and kind of "" cold shouldered"" me, just seemed to treat me different. Plus, when I went to scan in my ballot the guy directing people was trying to look at my ballot to see who I voted for. Honestly, I don't trust these people and I don't think the board of elections reinforce the rules to these people enough. The entire experience didn't feel right and I am pretty worried more of the same shennanigans are going to happen this election. How do you prove these electuon workers are biased and willing to commit low key underhanded crimes? I feel like the only way to get it under control is if a crackdown is made so these volunteers understand how serious their jobs are. How much trouble they can get into fucking around.... Also, they were ringing bells and celebrating first time voters everytime they went up to the window to get their ballot. I felt like that was a bit over the top.

I used to believe in this type of ideology. Maybe it was because of my ex who was extremely PC and worked with Transgender youths. However, after leaving her... I'm honestly starting to see the dangers and craziness of honestly both political parties. There are extremists on both sides, however, it seems that there a majority of republicans who just want to do the right thing. While the democratic party is increasingly getting crazier. I remember when CNN was actually one of the more honest networks you could watch. Now, it is so biased etc. I could imagine myself saying some of this shit a few years ago. Do I believe in legitimate cases of Transgender people? Absolutely. Do I believe that it is now becoming a trend and that ""Gender Identity"" is being forced down childrens throats. Fucking absolutely. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being LGBTQ+. But, allowing parents to grossly modify their children... based on feelings they have... that may just be due to imbalanced hormones due to growing... is absolutely fucking disgusting and should be prosecuted imho. It kind of has solidified my core beliefs and has me thinking about switching to the Republican party. Just wow...

I have been a far left democrat, and I believe it has something to do with the group of people around me. I feel like I was forced to believe in things, that legitimately have no evidence or are based on just emotion. What is happening to this country? 

On another note, whatever happened to civil conversation between parties. I remember when being a Republican / Democrat wasn't such a big issue. Sure we disagreed on some core principles, but we never were neck & neck. Just... wow.

As a Black conservative, I've often found myself in situations where I'm labeled as ""racist against my own kind"" or even accused of hating Black people. It's a tough thing to grapple with because nothing could be further from the truth. I love my community and take pride in my heritage, but I also have my own beliefs and principles that don't always align with what others expect.

For instance, just because I don't agree with everything Obama did or I'm not a fan of Kamala Harris, it doesn't mean I hate them‚Äîor Black people in general. I respect them as leaders, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to support everything they stand for. My values are what guide my choices, and sometimes those choices don't fit neatly into the expectations others have for me as a Black man.

I'm curious‚Äîare there others out there who feel the same? How do you deal with the backlash and accusations that come from simply having a different perspective? How do you stay true to yourself in the face of these challenges? Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who's gone through something similar.",Republican

I say this not in an argumentative manner, but moreso because I cannot find many reasons that prove she is a good pick. 

I am a first generation American. I'm in love with the idea of the American dream. I feel as if my life is molded around it. Along with all the ups and downs, and boy my life has been one hellride so far, I wouldn't be the same without this dream. I see myself becoming who I want to be and I am obtaining tangibles and intangibles that I never would've had I not worked this hard.

Many see Trump as a villain. This guy is a new York made man. An example to look up to. I believe he is a true protector of the American dream. He could've taken whatever money he was inherited and fumbled. He could've went to the Colonial inn and drank it all away. To me, he should be an idol to all Americans, especially young. However mainstream stereotypes seem very true, my generation (I'm 26) is lazy and wants handouts for everything. Free water, free healthcare, free is not always free. 

Kamala is going to tax hard working Americans. I know that I am not alone when I say I don't want to be taxed more because people can't find it in themselves to be diligent and make something of themselves.

>*Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign quietly edited Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's biography on Thursday to remove a reference to him as a ""retired command sergeant major.""*  
>&nbsp;    
>*Walz has fallen under scrutiny from Republicans for referring to himself as a retired command sergeant major when, in reality, he was only conditionally promoted to the rank but failed to perform the training necessary to permanently obtain it before retiring as a master sergeant in 2005, [according](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/past-criticisms-vp-nominee-tim-walzs-retirement-military-resurface) to a statement provided by the Minnesota National Guard to Just the News on Wednesday. Harris' website referred to Walz as a ""retired command sergeant major"" until at least Thursday morning, [according](https://web.archive.org/web/20240808003432/https://kamalaharris.com/meet-governor-tim-walz) to an archived copy of the page, but has since clarified its [description](https://kamalaharris.com/meet-governor-tim-walz) to note that he once served as command sergeant major without stating that he retired as one.*  
>&nbsp;    
>*""[Walz] retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,"" Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug√©, a Minnesota National Guard's State public affairs officer, told Just the News. ""The Soldier must complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Course as a condition of this promotion. Failure to meet the condition will cause demotion per AR 600 ‚Äì 8 ‚Äì 19,"" according to Army rules.*  
>&nbsp;    
>*Walz's original biography on Harris' campaign website called him ""the son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself,"" according to an archived version of the page. The current version of the website, however, calls him ""the son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major.""*  
>&nbsp;    
>*Walz is also facing allegations that he retired from the Minnesota National Guard early to avoid deployment to Iraq, claims Democratic operatives have denied. Walz, however, knew his battalion was likely to be deployed to Iraq when he retired as he mentioned the possibility in congressional campaign materials published before his retirement, the Washington Free Beacon [reported](https://freebeacon.com/elections/tim-walz-knew-his-battalion-was-being-eyed-for-iraq-when-he-retired-from-national-guard) Wednesday.*  
>&nbsp;    
>*""When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle ‚Äî not the other way,"" retired command sergeant major Thomas Behrends, who took Walz's place after his retirement and was deployed to Iraq, [told](https://nypost.com/2024/08/06/us-news/veep-pick-tim-walz-is-a-traitor-to-national-guard-source) the New York Post on Tuesday. ""He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president.""*

From curiosity, I wanted to find articles pushing out propaganda supporting the right. After scrolling a bit, all I noticed was propaganda putting down the right and highlighting the left, never vice versa. 

Kinda crazy how much sway the media has. As a swing voter, I‚Äôd like to get facts and information from both sides, but it all seems like marketing propaganda fluff. It‚Äôs a little frustrating knowing Media and my phone company is supporting one party when I‚Äôd like to have easy access to information to influence my vote.

I‚Äôve been here a little bit in the past but just wanted to say I am proud to say I am voting Trump this November. 

I decided this about a month or so ago. I‚Äôve usually voted 3rd party/libertarian candidates in the past, I voted Jo Jorgensen in 2020 and realized that this is not doing me or our country any good. As much as RFK Jr could be a good candidate he‚Äôs not going to win more than likely. 

I grew up in the south, have lived in liberal cities, lived in red states and blue states, currently live in a liberal city. I‚Äôve noticed that Biden/Harris don‚Äôt care about helping build up lower income communities and instead it‚Äôs all about hand outs, it‚Äôs not about building them up as people, giving them places to work, job skills, and helping get people on their feet. It‚Äôs about keeping them down so they rely on them and will vote for them every election cycle, but the kicker is every 3/3.5 years is when democrats rediscover these communities and pander to them. I‚Äôm sick and tired of seeing it as someone who lives near these communities. I want to see these people grow and flourish and make something of themselves, but instead I see the people who are actually getting legit help from the government are not even legal citizens here as we saw in Chicago/New York/Texas/California.

I‚Äôm tired of the democrats only caring about people specifically every election cycle and getting hardly anything done in between. 

In terms of Trump, while he‚Äôs not my favorite person, I think he‚Äôs better than Kamala Harris. I feel that his policies will help the population far more than Kamala Harris.

With Trumps legal history that we all know about, I think the justice system is highly against him for political reasons, I think he‚Äôs a manufactured felon and not an actual felon, I think Alvin Bragg and the DOJ took a weird misdemeanor and bumped it up to 34 felony counts. This is the same DA in NYC who‚Äôs taken violent felons and lowered them to misdemeanors. I believe he is being weaponized and it‚Äôs all to keep him out of office and I can see right through that and I hope you all can as well.

Joe Biden has taken classified information and been given a slap on the wrist, Hillary Clinton destroyed evidence and was given a slap on the wrist. I think Trump can be given a slap on the wrist and given a pass like the other 2.

I also don‚Äôt believe the whole project 2025 narrative they‚Äôre trying to create, this is a foundation that‚Äôs been trying to push a hard right agenda for decades and they‚Äôve never been successful and they‚Äôre not going to be successful with Trump now. Pay attention to his offical agenda, Agenda47.

When there was the assassination attempt, I saw Trump put his fist in the air and tell people to fight for what they believe in, and I think we should fight for a better America for all Americans.

At the end of the day, I do not want a SF progressive as a president. I think Trump will be better at keeping us safe, helping our economy grow, bringing higher wages back to our workers in this country, and helping get the US back to where it belongs. He‚Äôll be better for all groups of people and help everyone grow consistently. I think Trumps strong stances are what we need for the country and that‚Äôs a strong border, strong economy, ending wars overseas and negotiating peace deals. I believe he will win but keep spreading the word. 


Btw, my family all live in a very competitive swing state and I am making sure they vote Trump as well. 

Thank you all for reading.

-""Trumps RNC speech gives Democrats Hope"" It was one of the best he gave?? LMFAO. Talked a lot about his plan of action when he becomes president

-""Republicans are all for optics; they have no substance"" Did they forget Biden chose his VP and the first thing he said about her was talk about her race? Perhaps picking someone of merit and then acknowledging the historical component of the selection before pandering superficial reasons to pick a VP.

""Trump was low energy sleepy at the RNC"" Projecting much?

717,A note to our visitors,206,1e3bdtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/1e3bdtq/a_note_to_our_visitors/,2,2024-07-14 20:56:43,"So nice of you to stop by. I will tell you that 99% of your comments are immediately filtered away, so you are wasting your time.

You folks have ruined the neutral spaces with your disgusting rhetoric so now many of us tend to just stay here. We are not at all insulated from your points of view that are so incredibly monolithic (impressively so -- and dangerously so, some might say). We literally see them and hear them everywhere. You are like locusts, you are inescapable. We try to just enjoy some conversation with ourselves and you ruin it. So now we tend to congregate in subs such as this (though there are exceptions).

When you come and trash us and then we ban you, you cry ""Safe space!"" You almost all invariably say, ""I thought you were about free speech!"" If the founding fathers knew what you would do with their ideas, they'd have known we don't deserve the freedom they swore to protect in the Constitution. With all due respect, you don't know what the fuck you are talking about.

The freedom of speech comes with the responsibility to speak well, speak productively, speak honestly. You trolls who come here fail to do so. You fail to come here with intellectual honesty, you come here to troll and try to smear us, you come to be a thorn in our side, you come thinking you alone know the truth. But you don't. If you were honest you would know that you don't know the truth. You would know that just because a lawsuit has some bombastic claims it doesn't mean they are true because you have seen it before and because you have seen the opposite: people with no claims against them who turned out to be horrible people.

Your leaders and media have lied to you for the past two years (at least) about the health of Biden, we told you the truth and you told us we were evil for it. Your leaders lied to you about the origins of Covid and the effectiveness of the vaccines. We told you the truth and you vilified us for it. Your leaders lied to you about the Hunter Biden laptop. We told you the truth but you vilified us for it. You vilified us even after the truth came out about all these things.

These are verifiable lies that YOUR OWN LEADERS told you while we were telling you the truth, and yet you vilify us still.

We get a lot of users here who will tell us to kill ourselves, especially in modmail. It is illuminating to see their hyper-pleasantness in all of reddit except when they show up here and especially in modmail. That behavior is pathetic. I'm not perfect, I will tell a person to fuck off from time to time. That's not very Christian of me, but Christianity is not about being perfect, we all fall to sin at times. That is not hypocrisy, it's the difficulty of life. But folks that behave the way I just described above are true hypocrites. You have no honor, you are mindless folks with hate in your hearts.

Repent. God loves you and so do many of us even if you make it fucking hard to do so.

Even when you come with ""facts"", and on rare occasion some of you do, is the necessary to interject when we are trying to deal with a tragedy? No, you are being shitty when you do. There is a time for harsh truths and there is a time for mourning or just processing. Not realizing that shows a serious lack of decorum that you may say is relegated only to your virtual lives, but that same vile thinking pervades your whole life. That is no way to live.

Repent. Turn back. God loves you. But if you try to pull that crap in here, you will continue to be banned immediately.

EDIT:By the way, there are right wing folks who pull the same kind of shit TO US and obviously to left leaning subs. You deserve just as much condemnation as the folks I am addressing here. You are just as vile and disgusting and I want to publicly renounce anyone who behaves that way on reddit. You are ruining the discourse, you are wasting your life, and you should repent of your disgusting ways.",Republican

I'm hoping to connect with some conservatives on here. I'm 28-years-old and recently moved to Florida. I was a staunch liberal from 2015-2020ish, a left-leaning moderate until 2022, and now I consider myself to be a republican. While I was a liberal, I volunteered on numerous democrat campaigns throughout my home state and even aspired to be a democratic politician myself. However, my views began to shift when I was in law school and started to notice some serious issues with the democratic party and its platform.

In 2020, I finally started waking up. I did get the COVID vaccine, but I hated how it was pushed on us so suddenly and without much freedom of choice.

The straw that broke the camel's back was the democratic party pandering to the woke mob regarding issues such as transgender ""women"" in women's sports and women's spaces. As a former woman athlete myself, I am horrified by the current state of athletics at all levels that allow men to compete alongside women. It's abhorrent. Of course, if you speak out against this unfair practice, you will get ""canceled"" for being ""transphobic."" I feel like women have been totally forgotten, disrespected, and abandoned by the democratic party and I could NEVER give my support to a party that does not support me.

I am also stunned and appalled by the democrat support of ""Palestine,"" and silence regarding the atrocities being committed by Hamas in Israel. Israel is a beacon of hope in the Middle East and should be fiercely defended.

I am excited to align myself with the republican party and support Donald Trump in 2024. It's funny--I would've NEVER imagined myself voting for him in 2016 or even 2020, and now I am excited and proud to give him my vote in 2024.

I'd love to connect with other conservatives in Central Florida! Specifically, anyone who has left the democratic party like me. ",Republican
