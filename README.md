# Polarization on Reddit
This is an ML-based project, which studies polarization on Reddit. To that extent an LSTM-based neural network is built and implemented. The project was presented on an LSESU Data Science Society event.
The presentation slides are in the 'Presentation_Polarization.pdf' file.
