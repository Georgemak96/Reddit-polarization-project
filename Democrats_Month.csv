It appears Linda McMahon was named in a Sex Abuse Lawsuit.  Another Trump nominee who appears to have checked the ""Sex Assault"" box on the job application.  So we have the now former AG candidate, the Secretary of Defense nominee, and now the Education Secretary nominee.  

Trump sure can pick the winners.  Who is next?

But if just even a little overspray hits them, it may be worth it. 

What I find myself slipping into is reading the sanitized articles about what Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth have done to women and it not having the effect on me that it really should. I'd imagine these articles have more of a sense of terror for women, because there are so many that have been in somewhat similar or worse situations, but as a guy, I find myself glossing over it a bit until I really give it a minute to think of the reality of it all. So, maybe this is for the guys, but I wanted everyone to really THINK HARD and graphically about the reality of what those two did.

Imagine walking into a massive house at around 7am. Almost as soon as you walk in the door, ALLEGEDLY a coked out and mollied up Matt Gaetz grabs you, and immediately has sex with you. Then, later, you see him raping your underage friend on a pool table right out in the middle of the room while all these other weirdos just casually stroll on by. And you realize no one cares and this is like a normal thing to them. 

Or, imagine Pete Hegseth. WEEKEND anchor for fox news. So... you know, big time, or that's what he thinks. He is so out of control on a daily basis that he has to have a freaking handler when he travels. He is standing at a bar, bragging to two women who he thinks hes impressing with his service in the national guard, but they are getting creeped out and secretly contact his handler to come save them. She arrives to save them and succeeds. And, ALLEGEDLY, Pete the hero is so enraged at being cockblocked and missing the chance at cheating on a new wife that he proceeds to use the roofies he was going to use on those two women on his handler instead. So she gets a double dose and his handler doesn't realize what happened until the next day when she has bruises all over her legs and her husband has been frantically searching for her for hours. Then she gets tested and finds out she has Pete Hegseth's sperm inside her.

But I think misogyny ranks way higher than other factors, IMHO.

Even disinformation would work only catering to deep rooted beliefs. There is racism as well but misogyny is far more deep rooted in American psyche.

Lot of the right leaning pointers are about this macho manly stuff. The attack from Fox News has been more on Kamala Harris character - laughs, intelligence etc.. than any real policy.

The abortion ban is also about male dominance over women and dictating what women should do. 

Men are superior and women are inferior is the underlying factor in the right wing. Their anger about transgenders, school kids being indoctrinated with liberal views is in conflict with that mindset.

Looking through that lens, it‚Äôs almost impossible for them to think that a woman president can hold power and be assertive. 

It‚Äôs gonna be a really long shot to ever have a woman president in America.

The survey could be done in a way that presented it as ‚ÄúPresident Trump needs your help, please complete the following survey and return it in the included postage paid envelope‚Äù. Tying his name and asking for help would guarantee participation from his flock. Questions would be multiple choice and follow the following pattern. 

‚ÄúOn the day Donald Trump was elected with a Republican controlled Senate and House, was the unemployment rate:
A: 4.1%
B: 6.3%
C. 8.2‚Ä∞
D: 10.2%

On the day Donald Trump was elected with a Republican controlled Senate and House in 2024, was the inflation rate:
A: 2.2%
B: 4.8%
C: 6.5%
D: 10.5%

In the third quarter of 2024,were wages in the US:
A: Stagnant 
B: Declining
C: Up 1.4%
D: Up 4.4%

About 10 questions like this sent to enough base Trump voters would give Democrats ammunition to prove that Trump didn't win because he was the ‚Äúchosen‚Äù one, rather it would prove that he won because of misinformation. 
Not sure it would make a difference, but if they hammered it hard for awhile, it might help in the mid terms.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to see you attend!‚Äù the invite to Kevin Roberts‚Äô party read. I went along to the event, held at a swanky hotel in midtown Manhattan, but things turned rather sour when I spoke to Roberts afterwards.

‚ÄúMake it good, the first [question], otherwise you‚Äôre going to pound sand,‚Äù was Roberts‚Äô opening line.

I misheard the word ‚Äúsand‚Äù for something else, and asked Roberts for clarification. ‚ÄúIt means you‚Äôre a bunch of liars, is what it means. So make it good or we‚Äôre done,‚Äù he said.

I asked him why we were liars. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre done, I‚Äôm not talking to you,‚Äù Roberts said.

I started to ask him about Project 2025, which involves cracking down on immigration, dismantling LGBTQ+ and abortion rights, and diminishing environmental protections.

‚ÄúGo to hell,‚Äù Roberts said. I let him be, but shortly afterwards, while on my way to the bathroom, two security guards approached and told me I had to leave.

It was an odd end to the evening.

Yes. You were cheated out of a free and fair democratic election.

Instead of participating in an election to continue the American experiment of democracy, they ran a tyrant. With that intent, they broke the social contract that is our constitution.

Their senators, violated their oaths in the January 6th impeachment trial, where Trump should have been disqualified from re-election. 

Their corrupt judges allowed Trump to escape prosecution, and continue to be on the ballot. 

Trump and his advocates weaponized rhetoric to radicalize citizens against democracy. To spread so much misinformation, that millions of other voters made falsely informed decisions in the election. 

So after the election, Biden was wrong when he told us we should accept the election results, because ""You can't love your country only when you win.""

Because if you love your country, if you are a patriot, you should feel cheated. You should feel angry, about everything that led up to election day. 

Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't entitled to be furious that Republicans misused the Constitution and our system of laws to establish themselves an authoritarian government. Your country has been stolen from you. 

However, save that rage for where it matters. There is no evidence so far of voting shenanigans. And you're going to need to use that anger to resist the next stages of authoritarian takeover.

Let‚Äôs first acknowledge the ache, the exhaustion, the feeling of being taken for granted by a system that should stand for all of us. You have every right to be disheartened. But remember‚Äîour history, our fight, our determination stretches back generations. We are the descendants of powerful, resilient people who were told over and over again to sit down, to be silent, to accept a world that denied their worth. And yet they didn‚Äôt, and neither will we.

Look to the strength of those who came before: Martin Luther King Jr., who showed us the path of courage and peace; Rosa Parks, who taught us that resistance can start with a single, simple ‚Äúno‚Äù; and countless others who gave everything to pave the way. They faced walls built from oppression, discrimination, and silence, and yet they broke through.

We are the inheritors of this legacy. Now, in this moment, it‚Äôs our turn to keep that torch burning.

Let us fight smart. Let us fight peacefully. Let us build bridges, not burn them. But let us be absolutely unwavering in our conviction. We have the numbers, the power, and the unity to make change real. They may try to divide us, but we know that standing together is the only way forward. Together, we can bring forth a brighter day, not just for us, but for every generation that follows.

Do not let this moment deter you. Instead, let it remind you of the work left to do, of the lives yet to be uplifted, of the systems still waiting to be reformed. We won‚Äôt take this lying down. We‚Äôll organize, speak up, vote, rally, and protest. We will demand that this government serve its people‚Äîall of its people‚Äîwith justice and equality.

The road will not be easy, but remember, we are not alone. You are not alone. Together, we are unstoppable. And together, we will build a country that reflects the power, pride, and possibility of each and every one of us.

Stay strong. Stay united. Stay hopeful. The future is ours to shape.

Aren‚Äôt Democrats the party whose policies benefits the working class? Republicans policies usually cater to corporations, reducing their tax rates etc. Trump‚Äôs tax overhaul reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21% for example. They believe in trickle down economics. If the rich corporations have more money then they will take pity on the rest of us. Democrats platform is to tax them more and ease taxes for the rest of us. How is that not working class friendly?

Republicans are also the party who are against socialized services that benefits lower income people. Isn‚Äôt that why poorer people were traditionally more likely to be a democrat? Republican is the party of personal responsibility believing the government is not responsible for your life and problems.


How have Democrats failed to reach this population when their policies have always been more beneficial for them. Do voters just not understand the political platforms? Did we fail to effectively communicate this difference to new voters?

708,A letter to all,216,1gmgpg6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gmgpg6,42,2024-11-08 11:49:37,"To whom it may concern:

       I wanted very deeply to express something to the whole world, and express now something that I wanted to say to all of you very much. Yet I was ignored profoundly and more importantly, the group that I stand for, was also ignored very much by society. I cannot remain on the sidelines any longer, and I am now prepared to speak my peace and say what is in my heart.

       My name, in case most people do not know, is Christopher C Gagliardi. I am a 43-year-old male from a city called Englewood, New jersey, USA. Like so many Americans, I have a great life rich and blessings. I go to school, studying to become a journalist. I also have a wonderful mom who supports my every move and my goals. I have a wonderful community that has embraced me and has cared for me and everything that I have had has made me the person who I am today. However, 43 years ago, I was not like this, the man whose letter you are reading now.

For you see, 43 years ago - I was born with a challenge called infantile autism.

     For those who do not know what autism is, let me explain it very profoundly. At that time, no one really understood autism, and my frequent ‚Äútantrums,‚Äù aloof affect, and inability to speak baffled the people around me. I felt like a caged animal. I was frustrated because I lacked the ability to explain my thoughts and feelings, and simultaneously oblivious to the fact that was I unable to communicate. You see, Autism can be lonely, especially early on. 

    I was the only one who knew how hard it was to be autistic, because I lived it and felt that no one could understand me or my experience. My hometown did not have the correct special education programs for autistic or other special needs children, so I was bussed out to other public schools in neighboring school districts, which presented its own challenges. Among the challenges that people who are on the spectrum deal with every day, there was transitioning from a home and small-town environment to a new larger environment and school system.

    Another thing that is difficult sometimes for People with special needs is that they are expected to acclimate, even in school, to common-place daily events like holiday celebrations, decorating the classrooms, and other activities. Yet as a person with this kind of challenge with no steps to help me transition, to me, this was torturous and painful. In addition, there is the horrific and painful reality of bullying. I was called names, called ‚Äúretarded,‚Äù and subjected to physical violence, but my language abilities were not yet available to me, and I did not have the ability to tell my mom what was happening. Soon I was developing my ability to speak, and as my physical ability grew so did my desire to speak out to support rights for those who needed them.

    My confidence grew and I was fortunate to have the warmth and endless support of people who believed in me then and still believe in me now. The result has been a lifetime of breakthroughs: allowing my mom to hug me for the first time at sixteen-years-old after a bad encounter with bullying; a little acting, and some music; working as a community activist seeking to deliver a message about the rights of people with special needs; running for and winning roles in high school government up to and including student council president; and even taking a chance on college although there is still a need to fully address correct transitional programs for those with special needs seeking to move into a collegiate setting. 

   In 2005, because of my work as a community activist, I was honored by my political peers as a hero among Bergen County‚Äôs residents. I did these things by transforming ‚Äúthe impossible into the possible,‚Äù and by refusing to surrender or listen to negativity. I carried out these goals with the faith, love, and support of every single individual on my side that I was blessed to have surrounding along my entire journey. Their love and support lead to my decision that I would dedicate my life to fighting for change through politics and to bring attention to the issues that affect citizens with special needs. I have been fortunate enough to have been in the political game since I was, unbelievably, 12 years of age. I have made phone calls and campaigned for candidates.

Whether at the grassroots level, by getting out the vote with phone banks, or deciding to run for New Jersey State Assembly in the 37th legislative district. You read that correctly. At the time, I was concerned that no one could truly stand for the physically and mentally challenged citizens of our state. I educated myself on how to get onto the ballot, took the train with my petition and signatures to Trenton, New Jersey, and filed. My platform was simple: I was and still am for change in this country, a country I love so deeply. My attempt at a run for elected office got attention in media outlets and the story reached as far as the northwestern United States. In the summer of 2009, I won 15% in the primaries for my race. My opponents were so impressed that they appointed me the first Special Needs Outreach Advocate. All my life I can say that I am proud of the liberties that have been afforded to me and I take seriously the solemn responsibility of protecting them. Which is why I must now use this word: INCLUSION. Inclusion means to eradicate the exclusion of physically and mentally challenged people who cannot enjoy a normal life in school or society. And I will tell you that Exclusion or denial of someone is right to live a happy life especially here in this great country is WRONG. In my life, whenever I had doubts about my abilities or felt like I had failed, my dear friend and mentor Peter Noonan always told me: ‚ÄúYou create your own destiny!‚Äù

This leads me to the point of my letter and why this important election effects not just me, but millions of people with special needs in our country. As I said earlier, I was born with Infantile Autism. I have been fortunate enough to have been in the political game since I was, unbelievably, 12 years of age. I have made phone calls and campaigned for candidates. I ran for the state assembly and helped eradicate the R word from the language in our state and to make the toughest Anti-Bullying bill of rights. Why can I say all these things, it is because I can say that I was NEVER EVER scared of doing these things. Until now. 

I can honestly admit that for as long as I can remember, I can not recall a time in the history of this country or in the history of the 21st century had I ever seen a election where the very future of our country and all that we have so fought hard for, especially our rights as a person with special needs, was at stake in this election. 

In the year 2016 I was in absolute SHOCK when I watched Donald J. Trump mock a reporter with special needs during one of his campaign stops in the last presidential election. When you attack and mock someone with special needs, it is not only a violation of their rights, but of every single citizen with special needs and their families, period. As a person with special needs, I have a great fear for people with special needs and for others that if I woke tomorrow and heard the results that could be one of the greatest tragedies in our modern times. I wanted the press to talk to people with special needs and hear their side of things, especially with the election that just recently passed. However, we were ignored, and we were not given a chance. When the time came to fight for Kamala Harris, in the last few days of the elections, I was given the opportunity of a lifetime to go to the states and do everything in my power to stop Trump cold by telling the truth about his lies. So that 2016 would not repeat.

 On Tuesday night, November 5, 2024, I went home and went to bed hoping that this red monster, known as Donald Trump, would never ever get back in the white house. When I woke up Wednesday morning, November 6, 2024, at 5:35 a.m. and saw the results, that is when my rage exploded! I have been crying ever since.

     I am not only angry, but I am also furious with every single citizen who has betrayed America to the fullest by voting for Donald Trump because of so-called money, fear, misleading information, and so much more! They say greed is good, it is not!

    Money and greed are among the roots of all evils, there were other things too at play that made me sick!

      I was fighting for Kamala Harris because I wanted to fight for the people especially those with physical and mental needs who have not been heard! And now, with this monster back in the White House to become dictator, my greatest fear is that our rights as individuals with special needs will be destroyed and taken away for good. This is my heartbreaking fear and something I wish I did not have to say. now, I can only feel nothing but deep shock, and so much more. I have been contemplating as to express my feelings about this, and I believe now is the time to express what I feel. And so now, I would like to share that in this letter:

      I first have and want to, something to say to all the women who I fought so very hard for in trying to protect their right to their own choices: words alone cannot express my deepest grief, nor my deepest sorrow, as to how much I and many others have failed to stop this monster, and I cannot tell you how sorry I am enough! You are courageous, you are brave, and you are strong, please do not give up, please know that I am with you, and every man who believes in all your rights, will stand with you and continue to fight for you until the last breath.

     To the journalist who were doing their job covering the elections: I know you had to do your job and tell the full story, we commend you wholeheartedly for this, but I believe that more should‚Äôve been done to hear all sides, including those who were not given a voice, the people with special needs both physically and mentally as to how any presidency would affect them. I can only ask that you learn from this lesson about what you must do from now on, which is to hear from every group of people that deserve to be heard fully, including people with special needs.

     To all the dreamers: your voices are not going to be silent, you will be heard, and we will fight for you to remain on the path to become genuine Americans making contributions to society, and we will make sure that you are safe without a fear of bigotry, violence, and so much more.

      To my brothers and sisters in the LGBTQ community: Please know this‚Ä¶ know that you are not alone in this fight, you are not alone in this battle and war, we are in this war with you together so that we can correct the grave injustices, that for so long you have endured, and beyond that, you are safe with us in the loving arms of all who believe in equality, inclusion, and accessibility for all things to keep you going in this great citadel we call America! There will be times when we get wounded on the forefront doing demonstrations and so much more, and many of us will have to make sacrifices to fight to call into accountability the ones who caused this great disaster on November 5. We will learn from this lesson and we will stand together.

   To all my brothers and sisters with special needs, both physically, and mentally, the battle, for our moment has arrived, and now more than ever. We have to really change the system so that we can correct the flaws and the errors of our leaders and hold them to the highest accountability more than ever before,we cannot allow ourselves to turn back nor can we allow ourselves to basically be having our rights stripped away by this project 2025 that the Republicans plan to do. We will make sure that we will tell them where to stick this project 2025 and their plans against people with special needs.

     Now, I know many of you feel that I will just basically surrender. But I have news for all the naysayers and the Trump supporters who voted for this monster: I am not going to give up fighting, but I am going to fight like absolute furious hell in many ways. And not only that, but I am going to hold all those accountable in the name of justice, by calling them out and acknowledging their guilt for turning their back on this country and not electing a woman as president of the United States.... Again! 

    It happened before in 2016 when we had Hillary Clinton concede to Donald Trump and now Kamala! As an autistic person, I am extremely disappointed, incredibly angry, and outraged, there is going to be a day of great atoning coming when they realize that Trump is the liar and deceiver of all humankind. And I will say to them, ""see, I told you so!"" but it‚Äôs going to take all of us.

     Please, in the name of humanity, so many other philosophies and more, and in the name of democracy, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and so much more, don‚Äôt let democracy die in the darkness, don‚Äôt let the light of liberty be diminished or extinguished forever by this tyrant. It will be one of the greatest tragedies, and greatest tragic final chapters if we let it die!

I‚Äôm only calculating the substantial remaining vote, meaning I‚Äôm not doing it for states that are 99% reported, as that would take forever. I‚Äôll cluster those together in a lazy calculation at the end.

California ‚Äî 7,520,900 votes to be counted.

Assuming current splits hold up (though these votes may be more heavily in Harris‚Äôs favor):

Harris ‚Äî 4,332,038 Votes
Trump - 2,985,796 Votes

Oregon ‚Äî 257,107 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 257,107 votes
Trump ‚Äî 197,631 votes

Washington ‚Äî 509,070 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 297,296 votes
Trump ‚Äî 198,028 votes

Maryland ‚Äî 550,074 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 333,894 votes
Trump ‚Äî 201,877 votes

Arizona ‚Äî 825,835 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 384,839 votes
Trump ‚Äî 433,563 votes

Nevada ‚Äî 134,357 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 63,416 votes
Trump ‚Äî 68,522 votes

Now we will assume that every other state is collectively 99.5% reported, meaning ~715,567 votes remain. Since this is between both red and blue states, I‚Äôll just assume a 50/50 split on these votes.

This means **10,512,910** votes have yet to be reported.

This brings the final expected popular vote total to:

Harris ‚Äî 75,054,105 
Trump ‚Äî 77,813,469 

Overall: 152,867,574 votes

Compare to 2020:

Biden: 81,283,501
Trump: 74,223,975

Overall: 155,507,476

This means that 2024 turnout will be approximately **98.3%** of 2020 turnout.

So no, it is not true that we lost because ‚Äú20 million Democrats just couldn‚Äôt get off the couch.‚Äù Unfortunately, there was just an overall substantial rightward shift, which aligns with the incumbency disadvantage we‚Äôve been seeing globally due to inflation. ",democrats

Everyone is reeling from the results of this election and rightly so. Everything that we know about what America is, everything we were taught, everything we love and are proud of about our country is about to fundamentally change. 

I would like to suggest a few things going forward. 

Toughen up. Stop telling the world you want to cry. That‚Äôs exactly what they want to hear. Welcome to the Information Age. It‚Äôs all a propaganda game and a big part of our loss is from convincing young men what pussies we are. No matter how civilized it is to openly share our feelings, it‚Äôs a numbers game, and that‚Äôs simply a number you can‚Äôt ignore. We have friends and family to confide in.

While you‚Äôre licking your wounds, don‚Äôt spend so much time thinking about what we did wrong. Spend more time thinking about what we‚Äôre going to do more right next time. Take a page from their playbook. Look at how many times you‚Äôve ever seen conservatives admit they‚Äôve done anything wrong or corrected their behavior. Spend less time criticizing us and more time going on the attack. 

Time to stop fucking around and trying to be friendly. People are going to die. That isn‚Äôt an exaggeration. Just the appointment of that whack job RFK Jr. is sure to kill hundreds of thousands at minimum. All because voters can‚Äôt comprehend inflation after a global pandemic and think Donald Trump will fix it even though it‚Äôs already leveled off. They decided other people suffering is a fair trade for lower prices. Nothing civil about that. 

Lastly, that‚Äôs our goddamn flag. They have their flag. It says ‚ÄúTRUMP‚Äù usually followed by some other trashy thing. We‚Äôre the fucking patriots. Don‚Äôt let them own that. They don‚Äôt know what that symbolizes. They can wear all the 1776, we the people, don‚Äôt tread on me garbage they want. They voted to have a king and if they could have their way, he‚Äôd be king forever. 

We are the patriots, that is our flag, and this will not last forever. ",democrats

Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good‚ÄîGood afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, good afternoon. Thank you all.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. So let me say (crowd screams love you), and I love you back and I love you back. So let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, **the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting**. To my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much. To President Biden and Dr. Biden, thank you for your faith and support. To Governor Walz and the Walz family, I know your service to our nation will continue. And to my extraordinary team, to the volunteers who gave so much of themselves, to the poll workers and the local election officials I thank you. I thank you all. 

Look, I am so proud of the race we ran. And the way we ran it. Over the 107 days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. Now, I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it, but we must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.

A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, **while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign**‚Äîthe fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.

I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions, and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do. We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. And America we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.

And we will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square. And we will also wage it in quieter ways: in how we live our lives by treating one another with kindness and respect, by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor, by always using our strength to lift people up, to fight for the dignity that all people deserve. The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But, like I always say, we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work can be joyful work. **And the fight for our country is always worth it. It is always worth it**.  To the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be okay. 

On the campaign, I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing, **sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power**. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.


You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. **This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves**. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together. Look, many of you know I started out as a prosecutor and throughout my career I saw people at some of the worst times in their lives.  People who had suffered great harm and great pain, and yet found within themselves the strength and the courage and the resolve to take the stand, to take a stand, to fight for justice, to fight for themselves, to fight for others. So let their courage be our inspiration. Let their determination be our charge. And I'll close with this. There's an adage a historian once called a law of history, true of every society across the ages. The adage is, only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.

The light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.

And may that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America. I thank you all. Make God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. I thank you all.

861,Some context/perspective,137,1gl33aq,https://i.redd.it/jfkbkp39abzd1.jpeg,147,2024-11-06 16:54:28,"So to start off, I‚Äôm not an economist.  I‚Äôm not a pollster, I have no college degree.  I‚Äôm actually a firefighter by trade, a 36 y/o husband and father to 2 beautiful children.  This is just some musings that can put some things into perspective.  

This is definitely sad and shocking.  But, as shocking as this is, VP Kamala had a tough path to win even from the beginning for multiple reasons.  

1.) the incumbent usually starts fighting from behind.  If you look at recent American election history, the presidency usually flip-flops parties.  Yes, some candidates will get 2 terms, but the seat usually flips from D to R to D to R.  The problem in modern politics is that the incumbent starts on defense, while the challenger from outside has the luxury of pointing out *every single thing* that the incumbent did or didn‚Äôt do.  That presents a problem when things like groceries are wildly expensive.  **this is 100 percent not the fault of the president** democrat or republican, the president *does NOT* set the price of goods.  But you have to understand, the under-educated masses are absolutely lead to believe this.  

2.) not only was Kamala the incumbent, she is also the *vice* president, not the president, which may even make it harder.  She had to simultaneously prove that she‚Äôs *not* Joe Biden, while also not really being able to argue against any of his stances because she‚Äôs a part of his administration currently.  That‚Äôs a major challenge.  

3.) Kamala had a historically short campaign.  This makes the uphill climb even harder.  It was 2021 when Trump was insinuating he‚Äôd be running again.  To liken this to something easy to understand, in football the team with the greater time of possession usually wins.  Trump had a *massive* advantage being able to have much more time to plan and campaign.  Even with Kamala being able to out spend him, you need time to be able to tell people who you really are as an individual.  And like it or not, the general populace outside of heavily involved democrats didn‚Äôt know much about her.  

 4.) The elephant in the room.  The woman thing.  It‚Äôs terrible, it‚Äôs disgusting, it‚Äôs a shame, but the fact remains.  There absolutely were *some* dems that still could not bring themselves to vote for a woman.  Biden cleared 80 million votes, last I checked Kamala is sitting at 66 million and change and the race is over.  To think that the fact that she is a woman had no effect is erroneous.  

5.) Campaign focus & political climate.  The biggest issue for Kamala was her stance on abortion, which a lot of democrats (myself included) found very important.  But the Democratic Party had much more voters ‚Äúnear the center‚Äù than the Republican Party does, and while almost all democrats are pro choice, some of the more centrist democrats looked at their bank account, their grocery receipts, and the price they pay for rent and flipped.  Absolutely zero of what I just mentioned is controlled by the president, but again, the under-educated getting their news from Facebook only are easily deceived.  

This isn‚Äôt an all inclusive list, but it‚Äôs just some of the things I‚Äôve came across that I feel have contributed to the outcome that we have faced.  

It‚Äôs sad, we‚Äôre all upset about it, and some of us may even be worried for the future of our kids (as am I).  But we can either sulk in sorrow, or gear up for the work ahead.  There‚Äôs *no* quitting, there‚Äôs *no* giving up.  We move on to the next challenge in a couple years when more congress seats are up.

But it is because I could see this outcome being so likely, that I had also done more this year than any other previous election. This year marked the first year I donated to campaigns for Democratic candidates outside of my own representation. The first year I helped the local Dem committee hand out sample ballots. And yet I know full well that I could be doing more to help out. The outcome this year, also motivates me moreso.

Because at the end of the day it's not actually about supporting the party, it's for the people out there who want to feel like their voices are being heard. I hear them, I want them to know that I want to do what I can to help their representation, and what I want them to see is that we will not take losing as a sign to abandon them. If anything, it should remind us all of what we're really struving to achieve. An election is not about winning or losing like it's the super bowl, it's about sharing our vision for a better tomorrow, with all our fellow Americans, a people full of diversity and contradictions, so alike we are, even if we may never really agree on values.

Like Biden said, ""You can't love your country only when you win."" Today, all of us who are members of the Democratic Party are now getting the opportunity to put those sentiments to the test. I would like to think we are capable of getting through these upcoming four years, and coming out of them stronger as a result, with a stronger resolve to keep fighting for the values we believe in, and to keep striving to make the country that we love a better place.",democrats

I always loved her, and so did my mom and grandma.  She's not only an amazing orator, she's a wonderful person, wife, mother, political figure, and champion of the free world. 

Her speech at the DNC was one of the most powerful things I've ever heard. The power this woman commands is astounding. Her voice, her tone, her vocabulary, her passion, she's just overall fantastic at getting her message across to a wide range of people. She just brings everyone together. 
 
I think she looks more beautiful now in 2024 than she ever has. Every time she comes out to give a speech, I find myself thinking ""holy shit this woman is a powerhouse"" I love when she wears a thick braid down her back, it suits her so well, and makes her look *so* badass. Because she is. She's a badass. She doesn't command authority, she *takes* it. 

Even Barack said something like ""I'm the only one stupid enough to speak after Michelle Obama."" He gave a great speech at the DNC as well. Michelle has such an infectious smile, and her words really hit home with a lot of people with different poltical views. Shes able to reach across the isle like that. 

Her style is incredible and I think she looks particularly lovely in purple. We were lucky to have her as our First Lady, and we are lucky to have her still. God bless you the Obamas and all they've done for our country. God bless the USA üá∫üá∏ ",democrats

I have never had a political bone in my body. 

I was annoyingly indifferent about the entire American project. 

So, with a heavy heart, I found it no longer acceptable to be inactive. 

I felt compelled to vote not for anything but rather against so much.

I have watched Donald Trump flaunt his self-serving destruction of our nation's norms. Mutating good Americans into the type of people who denigrate the very essence of what it means to be an American.

He has corrupted so many fine and upstanding people. 

Folks I knew to be kind and good-hearted regurgitating some of the most vial talking points and excusing some of the most sick moral failures of the former president. 

To name a few that come to mind.

Trump had an affair 4 months after his wife gave birth. 

Trump was convicted in front of a jury of his peers that he had r*ped E. Jean Carroll according to the common definition of the word.

Trump plotted to steal the 2020 election by attempting to pressure Mike Pence under threat of violence into certifying Trump's false slate of electors. 

As the mob chanted ""hang Mike Pence,"" Trump tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done."" 

Trump believes that half the population should be considered ""the enemy within."" 

He has degraded prisoners of war, saying, ""I like people who weren't captured."" 

All of these have been either dismissed or praised by American ""Patriots."" 

His cult followers will defend all his unacceptable behavior by saying, ""It's all jokes"" or ""It's the liberal media."" 

Defenses that only further highlight how much he has melted the minds of these people.

It's clear that all these criticisms are not baseless attacks. They are part of an established pattern of behavior that has been validated time and time again by folks with wide-ranging relationships with Trump. 

From former staffers, government and military professionals, members of his cabinet, judges, family members, business partners, experts, and many others. 

Folks from each group all share the same resounding and clear message. 

It's the message that drove me to vote, and it's a message I would like to echo here.

Donald Trump is not fit to be the next president of the United States.",democrats

It is a state of play that would have seemed unfathomable in the immediate aftermath of Trump‚Äôs chaotic exit. I have not forgotten the slow, horrifying realization that Trump was not going to leave office willingly. I have watched as his various sins and transgressions have been laid bare before the public. And I have watched as he clawed his way back to the center of American politics again, poised to be an even greater threat than before.

First time voter here who basically grew up under Trump. (I was ten when he was elected). I adore Obama but the only thing I remember about his presidency was his send off. I am disabled and can‚Äôt walk at all without support. I struggled with that a kid (and still do sometimes). So eventually I learned that my biggest gift was my voice. Since then I have loved seeing a good female role model who uses her voice well. I have been a fan of many over the years but Kamala is my ultimate hero. She demonstrates an amount of strength I didn‚Äôt know was possible, and she gives me an insane of hope. This is something I have needed not just because of growing up in such a divided government but because of my own struggles. When I was young, I was confused and didn‚Äôt know how I was going to navigate such a unique life. Those moments still come at times, and hearing her so be so confident, dedicated, and willing to keep fighting makes her such an inspiration to me.

So I did ball when filling out my ballot, because of my own personal story, and because of everything that‚Äôs happened in our politics over the last 8 years. I really started balling when my mom said ‚ÄúYou did your part.‚Äù I felt like it was the least I could do, while also feeling an immense amount of strength. I was ready to turn the page on the division and felt so much gratitude for having the chance be something so wonderful. (I still do). 

But it‚Äôs not just because of Kamala. Everyone who has joined this movement is so special. I wanted to say thank you to everyone here for being such a great community. I feel so loved and heard even though I am a stranger to all of you. 

I can‚Äôt forget to give a special shout out to all the Republicans out there. I have the ultimate respect for you guys. Thank you so much for your true patriotism. It is so brave to do what you did (especially in certain areas). On behalf of all of us I can never thank you enough, no matter the end result.

I‚Äôll say a little prayer for our country every night until after the election. Please join me in whatever way you feel comfortable (religious or otherwise). 

From a grateful community member, in a safe blue state trying to make just a little bit of a difference.

As I got to college and started to realize I had a choice I had such a hard time understanding how a vote for Trump would be best for me.

I‚Äôm a woman, I‚Äôm young, and I don‚Äôt feel respected or valued by Trump‚Äôs ideals. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around how my family can vote for someone who would likely take my reproductive rights away.

Not to mention the stuff I hear from my family is so vile. The hatred, racism, and homophobia (they don‚Äôt realize their daughter/granddaughter/sister is part of the LGBTQ+ community) is awful. I do love them but I hate that part of them. 

I‚Äôm voting for the Harris/Walz I think it‚Äôs the best option and also they seem fun and nice to be around. 

I feel like there‚Äôs probably a lot of these posts but I never get to talk politics or my beliefs because of my family. I am slowly working my confidence and gaining knowledge to better speak on political issues but wanted to share my perspective here.",democrats

I grew up in a Southern Baptist home under a staunch Texan mom and Marine Veteran Step Dad. As you can imagine, I just didn‚Äôt know any other life for many years and the intersection of my influences resulted in a conflation of my religion with my politics. I was young, so I don‚Äôt feel guilt but I do feel a little shame. 

You see, my upbringing was filled with unspoken hate. It was never deliberately spelled out for me or my siblings, but it was there. I hated the LGBTQ+ communities for being so obstinate in the eyes of god; ‚Äúlearn to control your sinful urges‚Äù was the foundation of how I understood their ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù (in quotes because I now understand it isn‚Äôt a *lifestyle choice* but rather *people trying to live their lives*). I hated immigrants for their desire to take what was rightfully mine as an American (the Good Samaritan was lost on me because I applied intent on people I had never met). I hated people of color through willful ignorance (never overtly, but rather a feeling of repulsion when the onus of the past fell on white people). But most of all, I hated democrats as an amalgamation of everything that was wrong in the world. 

I have to give one piece of significant credit to my parents, however; they instilled in me what I understood conservatism to be. A conservation of finances through economic policy that benefitted everyone, social policy that allowed people to rise out of poverty, and emotional policy that required deep thought with good faith questioning (‚Äútrust but verify‚Äù they would say). If you can see where this is going, I eventually began to use these foundations to put my beliefs to the test. 

Luckily for me, I was in high school during an era in which medical marijuana was only just beginning to enter the zeitgeist. There were news stories and documentaries and personal essays abound; despite not using cannabis I was intrigued. My father worked in the medical industry, so I dug in to find that the medical benefits were extraordinary! It was only a hop, skip, and a jump to finding out why cannabis had been made illegal in the first place: ‚ÄúReefer makes darkies think they‚Äôre as good as white men. The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.‚Äù
‚Äî Harry Anslinger, Founding Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics

This was glaringly obvious racism, the kind I was unfamiliar with. It was bold, overt, and just plain wrong. I researched the policies of politicians I supported, and they had no real reason to support the prohibition of cannabis beyond maintaining the status quo. A status quo whose origins were firmly planted in racism and nothing else. 

The first shift in my beliefs came to a head when Mike Huckabee gave a sermon at my southern Baptist mega church‚Ä¶ while he was campaigning for President. It just felt‚Ä¶ wrong. 

I abandoned my party‚Ä¶ for the libertarians. I still felt strongly about the left being bad guys, and found a group who outwardly maintained similar feelings for the right. I remained a Ron Paul libertarian for years. 

Until I started a job where I met Stephen. Stephen was funny, supportive, thoughtful, a good co-worker, and eventually a great friend. He had studied political science in school, and took this job in an unrelated field to support his girlfriend through school. We got to talking and he gently asked about my political beliefs. I think he understood quickly that I wasn‚Äôt exactly the most informed guy, that I knew just enough to be angry. He validated my feelings about libertarianism, but inquired what I liked about it. I ultimately conceded that I didn‚Äôt think it was a viable vote, but that the protest vote might get enough attention to force conservatives to enact ‚Äúthe fair tax.‚Äù A flat 12% tax felt fair on a very surface level, but Stephen, without judgement, explained how that puts an unfair burden on the lower class. The class of workers in which I existed. 

My mind was immediately opened to how backward some of my hard held beliefs actually were. 

The third blow to my beliefs came from Robert Reich‚Äôs ‚Äúinequality for all,‚Äù a documentary I recommend to everyone to this day. I had to know more, was every fabric of how I understood the world warped? In that moment, I made a decision to be okay with being wrong, even if it only meant I could correct course and be ‚Äúright‚Äù again. 

I read The People‚Äôs History of the United States, I listened to lectures and speeches from Bernie Sanders, I paid attention to the stories of women, I questioned everything until my understanding became more complete. 

In 2016, I cast my first vote on the left for Hillary Clinton. 

Winning me over, a southern baptist boy for learned everything he knew through the lens of the GOP, took time, a pure attitude of curiosity, and a whole lot of patience. 

I called Stephen years after I worked with him to thank him for his gentle approach. The fact that he remained open to hearing me, despite knowing where I stood and how deep those roots were, was fundamental to my growth. 

Looking back and seeing this growth, I‚Äôm proud of it. I‚Äôm proud of myself. I can‚Äôt go back to harboring hate and sowing division. We can‚Äôt go back.

I told her that she has socialist policies but is far from an actual socialist. Yes she believes everyone should have access to affordable healthcare, daycare, and higher taxes on the rich, but does that make her a Bernie Sanders socialist? Of course not.

But the campaign hit a snag when Johnson was asked whether he would repeal the CHIPS Act ‚Äî one of President Biden‚Äôs signature achievements ‚Äî which just so happens to be bringing $100 billion worth of investment in the semiconductor industry to the Syracuse area.

‚ÄúI expect we probably will,‚Äù the speaker replied matter of factly.

Williams soon jumped in to say that he opposed repealing the CHIPS Act and would lobby the speaker.

It was an awkward moment ‚Äî made all the more so by Williams‚Äôs own history of deriding the deal that will bring the semiconductor manufacturer Micron to the Central New York region as ‚Äúcorporate welfare.‚Äù Now he was again in the familiar position of affirming his support for Democratic legislation, even as he argued that Democratic policies had destroyed the country.

Shortly after the event, Williams‚Äôs team issued a statement saying that Speaker Johnson supported reforming the CHIPS Act, rather than repealing the legislation: ‚ÄúI spoke privately with the speaker immediately after the event. He apologized profusely, saying he misheard the question.‚Äù¬†¬ª",democrats

I‚Äôm a moderate conservative and voted for Harris.  People like Liz Cheney convinced me that I was making the right choice.  Her outreach across the aisle made a difference with me.   

I have struggled with mental illness.  I‚Äôm finally on the right meds and recovering.  At the height of my illness, I was a hardcore trumper.

Now I‚Äôm not constantly outraged I‚Äôm so much happier and healthier.  I really think a lot of trumpers have undiagnosed mental illness. 

My whole family are trumpers.  My brother works for a major Republican think tank.  Everyone thinks I‚Äôm still on the trump train.

Not for lack of early voters, though. I was in and out of the early voting location in less than 15 minutes and it would have been half as quick if they hadn't run out of ballot paper for the 3rd time today and needed to go get more to refill it =) 

Afterwards, I ended up staying at the cemetery for much longer than I expected, talking and laughing with complete strangers. Some of whom had traveled from other states to visit Susan B Anthony's gravestone and place their stickers there.

 I've lived here for most of my life and I've always known about it being a Rochester, NY thing, women lining up to place their ""I voted"" stickers on Susan B Anthony's gravestone every 4 years. I've seen the photos over the years and I know that even the pics I took today are sparse with stickers compared to how her gravestone will look by the end of election day on November 5th. 

Even though I knew about the tradition, and i had seen all the photos, and I've been a woman of voting age for well over 2 decades. I had never actually gone there myself to place my sticker. I had never felt the need or want to before. Until this time. Until today. This time it just feels different. This time it just felt so much more important. I'm glad I went.

‚ÄúIf I had to pick right now, I would pick her,‚Äù said Lauren Holden, who said she voted for Trump in 2020.

King spoke with Holden and four other undecided voters from Pennsylvania who asked Harris a question during Wednesday‚Äôs event. Three of the five told the veteran CNN anchor and election analyst they had decided to back Harris. Every vote is important in Pennsylvania, where Harris and Trump are virtually tied in recent polls.

Harris‚Äô response to a question to name a personal weakness ‚Äî that she has always leaned on a team of ‚Äúsmart people‚Äù ‚Äî resonated with Erik Svendsen, an IT worker in Conshohocken who is registered as a Libertarian. Svendsen told King he came into the town hall undecided, but would now vote for the vice president.

While Thistle remains undecided, she told King she came out of the town hall feeling personal ‚Äúadoration‚Äù for Harris, especially when the vice president made a point to speak to her following the event.

CNN offered to host a town hall event for Trump, but he declined to participate. The network initially proposed a second debate, scheduled for Wednesday. But Trump turned down that offer, claiming he ‚Äúwon‚Äù his debates against Harris and former President Joe Biden and that it was ‚Äútoo late‚Äù for a rematch against Harris, though the final debate during the 2020 election cycle took place Oct. 22.",democrats
