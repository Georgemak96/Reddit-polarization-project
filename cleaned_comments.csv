They also know that people who are like Hitler cannot be trusted and must be reined in and kept under thumb. The GOP and the SCOTUS used him to get votes and into power, but even then, the GOP has a slim margin of power and a lot of chaos in their caucus. They won\'t hand him, or even Vance, total power because they cannot be trusted. Make no mistake, the illusion of unity in the GOP is just that, an illusion. Behind the scenes, they plot and scheme against one another on the daily. Keeping the Status Quo in place is their best bet to maintain their power.\n\nAnother advantage we have today is Trump is no Hitler.\n\nHitler was intelligent and did good things for Germany (still a mass murdering monster and deserves to burn in hell for all eternity) and pulled Germany out of a massive depression after WW1 and made them into an economic powerhouse. Life for the Non-Jewish, average German was good under Hitler.\n\nTrump is old, stupid, has dementia, possibly has cancer or other terminal condition (hence why he has been rapidly losing weight, has pale thin lips, and is caking more makeup on to hide his deathly pallor), and will NOT cause an economic boom but a recession or possibly depression with this catastrophic economic incompetence that will piss off the majority of the country.\n\nTrump will be unable to rally support, publicly or politically, in the way Hitler did in Germany. Even then, Hitler had people trying to assassinate him all the time so even he didn\'t score that 100% lord and master level of loyalty he dreamt of. If Hitler couldn\'t do it being younger and more influential, Trump being an old, dying moron sure as hell can\'t.\n\nThe SCOTUS and the GOP know this. They know Trump\'s time is up and the MAGA movement will fall apart. They\'ll do what they can to cut social programs and give more tax breaks to billionaires and corporations, but come 2026, their party will be in the toilet, and they know it. They\'ll lose the majority in the house and senate, crawl back under their rocks, criticize everything democrats do and try again in 2028 to regain their power, but will lose because of the hatred there will be for Vance and his ass kissing of Trump. Yeah, it\'ll be Vance in 28 because he, along with Trump\'s ""cabinet"" will betray the Orange Fucker and 25th amendment his ass faster than you can say ""aortic dissection"".\n\nThe last thing that keeps the SCOTUS and the GOP from giving Trump total power: The American people. Americans are the most heavily armed, unstable, pissed off and violent population on the planet. If they gave Trump total power and he crossed the wrong line with the American people, there will be armed revolts, daily assassination attempts on political leaders lives and complete and total chaos. The cops will turn on them, the military will turn on them, and there will be no one to protect the GOP or SCOTUS or even Trump.

Notably, these restrictions often coincide with other measures that voting rights advocates argue suppress voter participation, such as strict voter ID laws, reduced polling locations in certain communities, and limitations on mail-in voting. These policies disproportionately impact marginalized groups, including racial minorities, lower-income voters, and those with disabilities.  \nYes, as of 2024, all but a few states offer some form of early in-person voting, but the length of the early voting period varies widely. For instance, states like Georgia offer nearly three weeks of early voting, while others, like Alabama, do not provide any in-person early voting at all.  States with limited early voting or restrictive election laws often face accusations of voter suppression. For example, Texas has implemented strict ID laws and reduced mail-in ballot options, which civil rights groups argue disproportionately affect minority communities. A 2020 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found that restrictive voting laws‚Äîsuch as reducing polling places or imposing voter ID requirements‚Äîcan create significant barriers, especially for older adults, people of color, and low-income voters. In some states, policies like purging voter rolls, limiting voter registration drives, and banning ballot drop boxes have further compounded barriers to voting, often in areas with high minority populations.  \n\nTo make voting more accessible, consistent, and secure nationwide, while ensuring fairness and maintaining high election security, several reforms could be implemented. These steps would address existing disparities in voting access and leverage technology while upholding the integrity of the election process:\n\n1. Implement Nationwide Standards for Voting\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tEarly Voting and Mail-In Voting: Require all states to offer a minimum early voting period (e.g., two weeks) and no-excuse mail-in voting to ensure accessibility for all voters.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSame-Day Registration: Allow voters to register and vote on the same day at polling places.\n\t‚Ä¢\tStandardized Voting Hours: Ensure polling places are open for consistent and sufficient hours across all states to avoid disenfranchisement.\n\n2. Expand Access to Voting\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tAutomatic Voter Registration (AVR): Register eligible citizens automatically when interacting with government agencies, such as the DMV, with an opt-out option.\n\t‚Ä¢\tUniversal Access to Ballot Drop Boxes: Ensure all voters have access to secure ballot drop boxes in urban and rural areas.\n\t‚Ä¢\tElection Day as a Federal Holiday: Designate Election Day as a national holiday to eliminate barriers for workers and students.\n\n3. Modernize Voting Technology\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tPaper Ballot Backups: Mandate that all electronic voting machines produce a paper ballot to allow for audits and prevent tampering.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSecure Online Voter Services: Offer online voter registration and ballot tracking, using strong cybersecurity measures to protect against hacking.\n\t‚Ä¢\tUpgrade Voting Machines: Replace outdated and insecure machines with modern, secure, and user-friendly equipment.\n\n4. Address Inequities in Polling Places\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tEqual Distribution of Polling Locations: Require equitable placement of polling stations based on population density and voting patterns to prevent long lines and voter suppression.\n\t‚Ä¢\tExpand Accessibility: Ensure all polling locations comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and accommodate voters with disabilities.\n\n5. Strengthen Election Security\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tRoutine Audits: Conduct mandatory risk-limiting audits after every election to confirm results and enhance trust in the process.\n\t‚Ä¢\tEnhanced Cybersecurity: Provide federal funding for states to protect voter databases and voting infrastructure from cyberattacks.\n\t‚Ä¢\tChain-of-Custody Protocols: Enforce strict procedures for handling ballots to prevent fraud or loss.\n\n6. Combat Disinformation and Ensure Transparency\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tVoter Education Campaigns: Provide accurate information about voting procedures, deadlines, and rights to combat misinformation.\n\t‚Ä¢\tTransparent Election Processes: Increase transparency in ballot counting, with bipartisan observers present during all stages of the process.\n\n7. Encourage Federal and State Collaboration\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tProvide federal funding and guidelines while allowing states flexibility in implementation, ensuring a balance between uniformity and local control.\n\t‚Ä¢\tCreate a bipartisan federal election oversight body to assist states with compliance and resolve disputes.\n\nThese reforms would make voting more accessible and equitable, reduce the risk of disenfranchisement, and maintain public confidence in the fairness and security of elections.', ""Exactly, in California we now have mail in voting & in person voting plus drop boxes.

This idea that the incumbent is the default nominee is stupid. I'm not saying he wouldn't have won the nomination, but there should've been a contest of some sort."", 'I believe that Donald Trump\'s election can be attributed to several factors. This is my personal opinion, not based on empirical data or statistics, but an analysis grounded in observation and reasoning. Here are five key reasons:\n\n1. Economic and Emotional Discontent:\nAlthough the economy has improved in measurable ways, many ordinary Americans have not felt these gains in their daily lives. For many, life today feels fundamentally different‚Äîand often harder‚Äîthan it did four or eight years ago. This disconnect between economic metrics and lived experiences fosters frustration and disillusionment.\n\n\n2. Dysfunctional Governance:\nWhile democracy remains a guiding principle, its execution often falls short of public expectations. Policies widely supported by the electorate‚Äîsuch as higher taxes on the wealthy, universal healthcare, or a living wage‚Äîare watered down or ignored. For instance, despite discussions about raising the minimum wage, the federal standard remains far below what‚Äôs needed to match inflation or ensure a dignified life. This dissonance between what people want and what the government delivers erodes trust in the system.\n\n\n3. The Influence of Misinformation:\nIt is difficult to explain Trump\'s continued support without acknowledging the role of misinformation. Social media, amplified by foreign and domestic actors, has distorted narratives and reshaped public perception. This has moved the Overton Window further right, allowing unacceptable behaviors, including Trump\'s numerous civil convictions, to be normalized or dismissed.\n\n\n4. The Mismanagement of Immigration Policy and Perceptions:\nImmigration remains a polarizing issue, not because of immigrants themselves, but due to the mishandling of both policy and public discourse. Misinformation has fueled fear and division, while the lack of tangible, respectful, and effective solutions has left the problem to fester. Instead of addressing the complexities of immigration constructively, political actors have exploited it as a wedge issue.\n\n\n5. Failure to Listen to Voters:\nBoth Trump\'s opposition within the GOP and campaigns against him by Democrats failed to meaningfully connect with voters. They talked at voters but didn‚Äôt truly listen to their concerns. Many Americans, in post-election interviews, expressed a belief that ""things were better when Trump was president."" While this nostalgia is often a reflection of personal circumstances‚Äîlife generally feels simpler when one is younger‚Äîit also underscores the appeal of a leader who speaks plainly and disregards traditional norms. This resonates with a public increasingly frustrated by a system that seems to ignore their struggles and aspirations.\n\n\nUltimately, Trump\'s presidency is not the root cause of America‚Äôs challenges but a symptom of deeper systemic issues. A growing number of Americans have lost faith in our ability to build a government that serves the collective good. Addressing this crisis of confidence is essential if we are to move beyond surface-level solutions and truly strengthen our democracy.', 'Putin and Elon=SCAM', ""MAGA doesn't care about law, the Constitution, patriotism, or integrity.

Rushmore', 'Throughout history, numerous world leaders have commissioned statues of themselves during their lifetimes as a means of consolidating power, projecting authority, and shaping their legacies. These self-commissions often coincide with significant and sometimes controversial actions during their tenures. Below is an examination of several such leaders, detailing the statues they commissioned and notable acts associated with their rule:\n\n1. Augustus (63 BCE ‚Äì 14 CE)\n\t‚Ä¢\tStatues Commissioned: As the first Roman emperor, Augustus extensively utilized portraiture and sculpture to propagate his image across the Roman Empire. He commissioned numerous statues portraying himself in idealized forms, such as the famous ‚ÄúAugustus of Prima Porta,‚Äù which depicts him as a youthful and divine leader.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotable Acts: Augustus established the Pax Romana, a period of relative peace and stability across the empire. He reformed the Roman tax system, developed networks of roads, and initiated major building projects, including the Forum of Augustus. His reign transformed Rome from a republic to an imperial power.\n\n2. Louis XIV of France (1638‚Äì1715)\n\t‚Ä¢\tStatues Commissioned: Known as the ‚ÄúSun King,‚Äù Louis XIV commissioned at least 20 statues of himself in the 1680s to be placed in Paris and various provincial towns, serving as physical manifestations of his rule. Ôøº\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotable Acts: Louis XIV centralized power, epitomizing absolute monarchy. He revoked the Edict of Nantes, leading to the persecution of Huguenots, and engaged in multiple wars, such as the War of Spanish Succession, which strained France‚Äôs resources. His extravagant spending on the Palace of Versailles exemplified his reign‚Äôs opulence.\n\n3. Joseph Stalin (1878‚Äì1953)\n\t‚Ä¢\tStatues Commissioned: During his rule, Stalin orchestrated the erection of numerous statues and portraits of himself throughout the Soviet Union, reinforcing his cult of personality. These statues depicted him as the embodiment of Soviet strength and unity.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotable Acts: Stalin‚Äôs tenure was marked by rapid industrialization and collectivization, leading to significant economic changes but also causing widespread famine. He conducted the Great Purge, resulting in the execution and imprisonment of millions. His leadership during World War II was pivotal in the defeat of Nazi Germany, but his regime was also characterized by severe repression.\n\n4. Saddam Hussein (1937‚Äì2006)\n\t‚Ä¢\tStatues Commissioned: As Iraq‚Äôs president, Hussein commissioned numerous statues and portraits of himself, prominently displayed across the country to assert his dominance. One notable example was the statue in Baghdad‚Äôs Firdos Square, famously toppled in 2003. Ôøº\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotable Acts: Hussein led Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War and the invasion of Kuwait, which triggered the Gulf War. His regime was notorious for human rights abuses, including the use of chemical weapons against Kurdish populations. He maintained power through oppressive measures and was deposed following the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.\n\n5. Kim Il-sung (1912‚Äì1994)\n\t‚Ä¢\tStatues Commissioned: The founding leader of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, commissioned grand monuments, including the massive bronze statue at the Mansu Hill Grand Monument in Pyongyang, to immortalize his leadership.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotable Acts: Kim Il-sung established a totalitarian regime characterized by strict state control and the suppression of dissent. He initiated the Korean War by invading South Korea in 1950, leading to a protracted conflict. His policies isolated North Korea and created a pervasive cult of personality.\n\n6. Muammar Gaddafi (1942‚Äì2011)\n\t‚Ä¢\tStatues Commissioned: Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, commissioned various statues and portraits of himself, often portraying revolutionary themes. These were displayed in public spaces to reinforce his authority.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotable Acts: Gaddafi‚Äôs rule was marked by the implementation of his political philosophy outlined in the ‚ÄúGreen Book,‚Äù leading to the establishment of a unique form of governance. His regime was implicated in international terrorism, including the Lockerbie bombing. Domestically, he suppressed political opposition and was eventually overthrown during the Libyan Civil War in 2011.\n\n7. Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov) (1940‚Äì2006)\n\t‚Ä¢\tStatues Commissioned: Niyazov, self-declared ‚ÄúTurkmenbashi‚Äù (Leader of the Turkmen), commissioned numerous golden statues of himself, including a rotating golden statue in Ashgabat that always faced the sun.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotable Acts: His presidency was characterized by authoritarian rule and an extensive cult of personality. He renamed months of the calendar after himself and his family and implemented eccentric policies, such as banning opera and ballet. His governance isolated Turkmenistan and curtailed freedoms.\n\n8. Daniel Ortega (1945‚ÄìPresent)\n\t‚Ä¢\tStatues Commissioned: As Nicaragua‚Äôs president, Ortega has overseen the installation of large metal silhouettes of himself and other revolutionary figures throughout Managua, symbolizing his enduring influence.\n\t‚Ä¢\tNotable Acts: Ortega‚Äôs tenure has seen allegations of electoral fraud, suppression of political opposition, and human rights abuses. His administration has been criticized for undermining democratic institutions and restricting press freedom.\n\nThe commissioning of self-statues by these leaders often coincided with efforts to consolidate power, suppress dissent, and promote a specific ideological narrative.

I have a lot of fans, and they were not happy about it. And this was a very obnoxious guy who was a troublemaker who was looking to make trouble.‚Äù Trump constantly engages in rhetoric that stokes violence and presents the liberal half of the country as traitors who need to be brought to heel.\n\nThe second point being made was that Trump was a threat to our democracy.\n\nThis also holds true as Trump constantly pushes to consolidate power in the executive by subverting checks and balances. We can see this with the way Trump handled the DOJ, interacted with Comey, and was overall frustrated when his cabinet informed him of the limitations of the presidency and said he couldn‚Äôt do something through unitary presidential processes. Trump has also challenged the peaceful transfer of power and attempted to subvert the will of the American electorate by using a false slate of electors to try and remain in office. These are not healthy challenges to our system as they serve only to weaken our faith in the system and create weaker Judicial and Legislative branches relative to our Executive.\n\nThe third point relates to our government and its status as a democracy.\n\nIt is undoubtedly understood that the United States is a Democratic Republic. At our foundation we hold it that democracy is how we determine the will of the people and that the government should act in accordance to that. Republics are a democratic form of government in which representatives are democratically chosen to cast votes in favor of policies that favor their electorates. Pro-democratic ideas can be found all across our founding documents whether they be the Declaration of Independence when Jefferson writes ‚ÄúThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚ÄîThat whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.‚Äù or when  Thomas Paine in Common Sense describes the rise of Republican government as a necessary aspect of the expansion of a democratic state, for after all ‚ÄúBut as the Colony encreases, the public concerns will encrease likewise, and the distance at which the members may be separated, will render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on every occasion as at first, when their number was small, their habitations near, and the public concerns few and trifling. This will point out the convenience of their consenting to leave the legislative part to be managed by a select number chosen from the whole body, who are supposed to have the same concerns at stake which those have who appointed them, and who will act in the same manner as the whole body would act were they present.‚Äù \n\nWe are fundamentally built on democratic principles and are in effect acting as one. This is not to mention that in modern day America, voting rights have largely been expanded upon and populations of the states can set policy forth based on the will of the constituents of that state. By this I mean that constituents directly vote in favor or against specific policies in the form of ballot measures or propositions (such as what we have here in my home state of California) \n\nSorry for the rant but I quite like conversation with folks across the aisle and find it baffling that it seems to me that we live in such opposite worlds today.
