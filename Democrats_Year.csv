I‚Äôm only calculating the substantial remaining vote, meaning I‚Äôm not doing it for states that are 99% reported, as that would take forever. I‚Äôll cluster those together in a lazy calculation at the end.

California ‚Äî 7,520,900 votes to be counted.

Assuming current splits hold up (though these votes may be more heavily in Harris‚Äôs favor):

Harris ‚Äî 4,332,038 Votes
Trump - 2,985,796 Votes

Oregon ‚Äî 257,107 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 257,107 votes
Trump ‚Äî 197,631 votes

Washington ‚Äî 509,070 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 297,296 votes
Trump ‚Äî 198,028 votes

Maryland ‚Äî 550,074 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 333,894 votes
Trump ‚Äî 201,877 votes

Arizona ‚Äî 825,835 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 384,839 votes
Trump ‚Äî 433,563 votes

Nevada ‚Äî 134,357 votes to be counted

Harris ‚Äî 63,416 votes
Trump ‚Äî 68,522 votes

Now we will assume that every other state is collectively 99.5% reported, meaning ~715,567 votes remain. Since this is between both red and blue states, I‚Äôll just assume a 50/50 split on these votes.

This means **10,512,910** votes have yet to be reported.

This brings the final expected popular vote total to:

Harris ‚Äî 75,054,105 
Trump ‚Äî 77,813,469 

Overall: 152,867,574 votes

Compare to 2020:

Biden: 81,283,501
Trump: 74,223,975

Overall: 155,507,476

This means that 2024 turnout will be approximately **98.3%** of 2020 turnout.

So no, it is not true that we lost because ‚Äú20 million Democrats just couldn‚Äôt get off the couch.‚Äù Unfortunately, there was just an overall substantial rightward shift, which aligns with the incumbency disadvantage we‚Äôve been seeing globally due to inflation. ",democrats

Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good‚ÄîGood afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, good afternoon. Thank you all.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. So let me say (crowd screams love you), and I love you back and I love you back. So let me say my heart is full today. My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve. The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, **the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting**. To my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much. To President Biden and Dr. Biden, thank you for your faith and support. To Governor Walz and the Walz family, I know your service to our nation will continue. And to my extraordinary team, to the volunteers who gave so much of themselves, to the poll workers and the local election officials I thank you. I thank you all. 

Look, I am so proud of the race we ran. And the way we ran it. Over the 107 days of this campaign, we have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together from every walk of life and background, united by love of country with enthusiasm and joy in our fight for America's future. And we did it with the knowledge that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. Now, I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it, but we must accept the results of this election. Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.

A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it. At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, **while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign**‚Äîthe fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.

I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions, and aspirations. Where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do. We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. And America we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.

And we will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square. And we will also wage it in quieter ways: in how we live our lives by treating one another with kindness and respect, by looking in the face of a stranger and seeing a neighbor, by always using our strength to lift people up, to fight for the dignity that all people deserve. The fight for our freedom will take hard work. But, like I always say, we like hard work. Hard work is good work. Hard work can be joyful work. **And the fight for our country is always worth it. It is always worth it**.  To the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. But please know it's going to be okay. 

On the campaign, I would often say when we fight, we win. But here's the thing, here's the thing, **sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is don't ever give up. Don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place. You have power. You have power**. And don't you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.


You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world. And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. **This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves**. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together. Look, many of you know I started out as a prosecutor and throughout my career I saw people at some of the worst times in their lives.  People who had suffered great harm and great pain, and yet found within themselves the strength and the courage and the resolve to take the stand, to take a stand, to fight for justice, to fight for themselves, to fight for others. So let their courage be our inspiration. Let their determination be our charge. And I'll close with this. There's an adage a historian once called a law of history, true of every society across the ages. The adage is, only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.

The light, the light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.

And may that work guide us even in the face of setbacks toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America. I thank you all. Make God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. I thank you all.

I have never had a political bone in my body. 

I was annoyingly indifferent about the entire American project. 

So, with a heavy heart, I found it no longer acceptable to be inactive. 

I felt compelled to vote not for anything but rather against so much.

I have watched Donald Trump flaunt his self-serving destruction of our nation's norms. Mutating good Americans into the type of people who denigrate the very essence of what it means to be an American.

He has corrupted so many fine and upstanding people. 

Folks I knew to be kind and good-hearted regurgitating some of the most vial talking points and excusing some of the most sick moral failures of the former president. 

To name a few that come to mind.

Trump had an affair 4 months after his wife gave birth. 

Trump was convicted in front of a jury of his peers that he had r*ped E. Jean Carroll according to the common definition of the word.

Trump plotted to steal the 2020 election by attempting to pressure Mike Pence under threat of violence into certifying Trump's false slate of electors. 

As the mob chanted ""hang Mike Pence,"" Trump tweeted, ""Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done."" 

Trump believes that half the population should be considered ""the enemy within."" 

He has degraded prisoners of war, saying, ""I like people who weren't captured."" 

All of these have been either dismissed or praised by American ""Patriots."" 

His cult followers will defend all his unacceptable behavior by saying, ""It's all jokes"" or ""It's the liberal media."" 

Defenses that only further highlight how much he has melted the minds of these people.

It's clear that all these criticisms are not baseless attacks. They are part of an established pattern of behavior that has been validated time and time again by folks with wide-ranging relationships with Trump. 

From former staffers, government and military professionals, members of his cabinet, judges, family members, business partners, experts, and many others. 

Folks from each group all share the same resounding and clear message. 

It's the message that drove me to vote, and it's a message I would like to echo here.

He‚Äôs a guy in his mid-20s from Mississippi originally and works in Atlanta now. We talked for about 30 min while he was driving and I had a genuine connection with him while he was explaining what was most important to him. The economy was a big point, he didn‚Äôt like how the top 1% has benefitted from so many policies (Trump‚Äôs tax cuts absolutely fueled this). He was also disappointed with the Jan 6 attempted coup and abortion bans in the south. He doesn‚Äôt necessarily buy into the ‚Äúdoom and gloom‚Äù messaging on the left, which I didn‚Äôt want to push because I wanted to keep the convo going, and we left with him leaning less towards trjmp and more undecided but very interested in reading more about each platform. We talked for awhile about my family and situation and what I felt would benefit the middle class by the Harris/Walz plan. Ultimately he‚Äôll make his own decision but I felt so refreshed from this call because he‚Äôs in the demographic we all see as ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù trumpies: young white men. I told him to tell all his friends to vote and he was eager to do so. I felt like if this was a troll, our call would not have lasted so long (27 min!). If you can, please volunteer to phone bank. There are a lot of people who hang up or are rude and that‚Äôs fine. I got this one caller and 10 others who gave me SO much hope.

Every time they step on the gas, it has the opposite intended effect, also known as the Streisand Effect. And it seems like the Harris-Walz campaign and Democrats are capitalizing on this phenomenon by using every right-wing distraction as a guide for their own messaging.

Examples of backfiring messages include: Fox News deceptively editing President Biden‚Äôs comment about threats of election day violence, which only focused attention on the January 6th insurrectionists; Jill Stein got her name on the ballot in Wisconsin, where Biden won in 2020, only to remind everyone that her 2016 third-party candidacy sabotaged Hillary Clinton‚Äôs election; Trump‚Äôs unhinged rally speeches have only magnified his fourth-grade speaking abilities, his racist obsession with genetics, and his lack of understanding how anything works.

And Democrats have been optimizing these distractions and bombshells. One shocking revelation from the new book by Bob Woodward that Trump shipped COVID testing equipment to Vladimir Putin, which Russia then corroborated, has been widely reported. Also, news that Trump and dozens of republicans were endorsed by a right-wing trophy hunting group that targets adorable pigmy hippos like the famous Moo Deng, has been making the rounds.

Democrats aren‚Äôt just boosting damaging bombshells. They are also highlighting the duds. The dockworkers strike that caused momentary panic about supply chain interruptions before the holidays ‚Äì which was supposed to be Trump‚Äôs October surprise ‚Äì ended after only two days, and made Biden look like a champion of unionized labor.

Democrats have also taken a creative approach to messaging. FEMA added a ‚ÄúHurricane Rumor Response‚Äù page to their website telling the truth about FEMA‚Äôs heroic handling of the hurricanes. And Kamala Harris spoke directly to the Weather Channel‚Äôs 1.17 million subscribers.

Let‚Äôs not forget law enforcement. The FBI thwarted a planned election-day terrorist attack, sending two resounding messages: The intelligence community is keeping voters safe; and anyone planning terrorist attacks is under surveillance and will be caught.

'Analysts' and 'experts' discuss why trump would campaign in firmly blue states (Colorado also) when that time would be better used in a swing state. It easy to see why he's doing it when you remember:

A new Congress gets sworn in on January 3, 2025:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/119th_United_States_Congress

The 2025 Counting and Certification of Electoral Votes in Washington, DC occurs on January 6, 2025.

https://www.govexec.com/management/2024/09/additional-security-will-be-place-jan-6-2025-certification-presidential-vote/399498/

trump will unquestionably dispute the election and tie things up in court; with the plan to get the election before a friendly Congress and steal it.

ü§óI voted for üíô Madam President Kamala Harris 
& Vice President Tim Walz üíô of course! Also YES on Issue 1, of course! I voted for all the democrats I could choose. Unfortunately, in Ohio, there were quite a few positions that had republican options only. üòî I hope that changes in Ohio üíô soon. 

The parking lot was practically full, and a bunch of people there to vote, but there wasn‚Äôt a wait. It was quite a long walk for the voting process considering I‚Äôm very ill. However, I wanted my vote to count and in a deep red area I wasn‚Äôt trusting this maga republican controlled area with my absentee ballot. 

A woman asked me if I‚Äôd like to sit down, I said yes please just for a moment. I didn‚Äôt realize she meant to vote. Which sounds lovely until you realize you have no privacy. I mean absolutely no privacy at all! I probably should have said umm no thanks üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è, but I was embarrassed enough (that‚Äôs a personal issue about my health, age & disability). If I had an issue I could quite easily raise my hand, reach out & touch any one of the multiple poll workers, or whisper for help they were so close. üòï The poll workers looking at how I‚Äôm voting, repeatedly. üëÄ Every person walking around the line for a voting station could easily read my screen/vote selection. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

But, even the standing vote area was lacking privacy. There was a partition, yet it didn‚Äôt really keep anything private. I don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt do the booths with the curtains anymore?! Luckily I was able to snatch my printed vote selections before the poll worker did, and reassured them I‚Äôve got it from here thanks. 

üòä At least scanning my ballot went better this year.  This guy didn‚Äôt insist on taking it, reading it or putting it in the machine. He reassured me it can go in just about any way I wanted. Upside down and top end first. The machine didn‚Äôt show my selections. Only that my ballot was counted. Shew, yay!!! üòÑ 

A very nice cop at the entrance was welcoming and holding the door. As I left, I thanked him again, wished him a good day. He went on a bit, kindly. Then I said I hope they bring you lunch soon! Then he mentioned McDonald‚Äôs. I replied well it‚Äôs all American with a laugh. He said yeah I don‚Äôt eat any foreign foods! üòß He was dead serious. ü•¥ I replied I like a lot of foreign foods, but yeah everyone knows McDonald‚Äôs from birth. üò¨ ha ha üòï ü§î I‚Äôm thinking really, that‚Äôs how crazy this has gotten?! üòî

I‚Äôm glad I voted üó≥Ô∏è Hopefully they don‚Äôt pull any shenanigans with my vote. And I pray we pull through this election.

I want to share an incredible interaction I had.,1535,1eyyax2,https://i.redd.it/lcqpxxpuyakd1.jpeg,77,2024-08-23 00:48:33,"At the rally, I was seated next to a 90 year old black woman. She was instrumental in the civil rights movement in Milwaukee, working along side James Groppi. She showed me so many pictures and shared stories with me about her life, and what she went through to fight for her freedoms. She was born in 1934, and has endured so much hardship and effort just to hope to be considered an equal.

The entire time the Kamala was on stage, this woman was squeezing my hand. My eyes were watering like a damn hose. It was incredible and so powerful sitting next to her. I can't put into words the emotions I felt while sharing that moment with her, squeezing my hand while she smiled and cried happy tears.

It was surreal, it was such a strong emotion that I've never felt before. I'll never forget that, or forget her. That moment will live in the forefront of my brain for the rest of my life. I'm getting teary-eyed right now just thinking about her. She said ""this right here young man, this right here is what l've sacrificed so much of my life for. This right here is the best moment of my life. Thank you for being here to experience it with me"".

This world can be a scary place for us all, and this experience reaffirmed my belief that our country is healing.
I don't have anyone else to share this with, so I hope some of you appreciate the fact that this woman is witnessing what she has fervently fought for. So many people in this country have fought tooth and nail for their freedom, and for this woman to be sitting next to me, a 30 year old white man, experiencing this with her was truly the best moment of MY life as well. 
‚Äî

I tried posting this to other subs, with all political text changed to neutral words/names. Even made the effort to edit the photo to hide the jumbotron. For some reason a story of an incredible woman who fought for her civil rights is offensive to some. This interaction could‚Äôve happened anywhere and I would share it just the same.

My mom and I are kind of in a heated discussion about, of course, politics.

My question is, how exactly does the Democratic Party (and the other one too, I suppose) choose a candidate? I‚Äôm not old enough to have voted in a lot of elections, just since 2016. But I don‚Äôt remember the people choosing Hilary, it seemed like most Dems I knew were gung-ho about Bernie and were disappointed when Hilary was chosen over him. I guess I was always under the impression that we don‚Äôt have a whole lot of say in who is chosen as candidate, and I‚Äôm just wondering how much of that is true and how much of it is naivety.

In the past few weeks I‚Äôve had several conversation with Republicans I have known for years and some for just a week or two. 

These are the topics that are changing minds:
1. Mass Deportation: Even my MAGA mom doesn‚Äôt want to see her Vietnamese hairstylist or her Chinese Oncologist deported. I could make no headway with mom for almost a decade but I have finally broken through and mom brought dad with her.
2. Retirement Benefits: My second cousin is a retired colonel and a major Republican. I showed him how Project 2025 is planning to take away his inflation adjusted benefits. He was understandably pissed.
3. Supreme Court placing the President above the law: At least some of the MAGA really don‚Äôt like that because it is clearly unconstitutional even to the 2a worshipers.

Let‚Äôs be clear these are all Republicans. A vote away from R and one more vote for D.

Maybe we start talking to our family, friends and acquaintances about what the future holds if Rs win in November?

i **understand** it's infuriating that his enablers make excuses for him.  

i **understand** it's heartbreaking when everyone around him ignores everything they see and hear and pretend nothing happened.   

i **understand** a new set of rules seems to be invented just for him, and him *only*.

i **understand** its triggering to keep being told you're ""overreacting"".

i **understand** how it feels to be told that *you're* the problem, and that *you* made him hurt you by not just letting him ""blow off steam""

i **understand** his enablers are just as terrified of him, and that's why they keep supporting him.  

i **understand** when the courts keep giving him another chance to come back and finish the job.  

i **understand** the constant feelings of impending doom everytime he's present

i **understand** feeling isolated and questioning yourself and wondering if everyone else is right when they say you're just ""being too sensitive"" and reduces everything he does into a ""joke"" that you ""misunderstood"" 

i **understand** never being able to hide from or avoid him.   

i **understand** losing friends and family because he keeps lying to them and you can't change their minds, even when you show them the receipts. 

i **understand** because i *survived* it.  

But America, all is **not lost** and you are **not** crazy. Everything you feel is valid. Everything you have experienced **really did happen to you**. you **will** come out of this stronger, happier and better. 

I know that seems impossible to even imagine right now. i know you feel lost and defeated, but i promise you are not alone. i know it's terrifying to think about and predict his reaction based on all the times you tried to get out of this relationship, but *you have to cut all ties with him*. you have to get him out of your house. you have to pile all his crap on the curb. you have to change the locks. you have to block all contact and refuse to listen to anyone who advocates for him. but, you **can** escape him.     

America, you **have to vote** and you **have to vote for Joe Biden**. that's the *only* way you **survive** this abusive relationship. **you're not a victim America, you're a survivor** never forget that.

At the debate Thursday night, I attended the watch party Biden spoke at directly after leaving the CNN set. Because I didn't get to hear much of the actual debate with all the noise, interacting with him in person was how I judged how well he was holding up that night.

Honestly, it seemed like he shook every supporter's hand in the room. He spoke to so many people, walked into the crowd, pushed past his Agents' requests that they hurry up and leave, and kept his Scranton charm the whole time.

When it was my turn to speak with the President, I told him about my race, my opponent Brian Jack, and the difficulties I face in running against a MAGA machine. He took in every word, asked me more details, and let me know that he understood the stakes of my race. Then I was able to connect more with Dr. Jill Biden's team.

I'm happy to say both the Biden-Harris campaign and Biden himself have been a wonderful asset to work with this election.

Brian Pritchard, the first vice-president of the state Republican party, illegally voted in nine elections from 2008 to 2010 while he was still on probation for a 1996 forgery felony conviction in Pennsylvania. Georgia and 14 other states require people to have completed their sentence, including probation, before they can vote. About 163,475 people could not vote in Georgia in 2022 because they were on felony probation, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice non-profit.‚Äù*

Michigan: With Gretchen at the helm, Democrats in the state have won a trifecta for the first time in nearly 40 years. With that kind of power, they‚Äôve passed epic [election laws](https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/news/press-releases/2023/11/30/whitmer-signs-election-bills-to-ensure-every-vote-can-be-cast-and-counted) that should help Democrats.

Wisconsin: They‚Äôve just created new state maps which gives the Dems a likelihood of winning back the state senate and a coin flip from winning the state house. That should turn out lots more apathetic democrats just on a local level. Also, the supreme court just announced they‚Äôre looking into bringing back more [ballot boxes.](https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-absentee-ballots-drop-boxes-supreme-court-17a8a322d20e2562d23016e98978ad0b)

Arizona: With Kari Lake as the highest state-level office on the ballot, I genuinely believe she alone will keep Arizona blue. Just like Trump, she will turn out more people against her than for her.

Pennsylvania: This is just a gut thing but I can‚Äôt see it flipping back to Trump, especially with Philly and the whole ‚Äújoe from scranton‚Äù thing.

Georgia and Nevada are my most worrisome ones. But in this scenario, we would just need PA, MI, and AZ. Not to mention NC potentially being in play with Robinson running for governor (could have a Lake effect).
